I began my journey into the Malazan series in a similar manner that I’m sure some others have. I was sure I’d fall on the side of those who didn’t like this. The reviews are so polarising, and so many people talk about how difficult this series is. I don’t have the time or energy for that, but all of my friends are reading or have already read this. Am I really going to be the only one who hasn’t?
Then I thought: maybe I’ll just read the first one, this world sounds so interesting, I feel like I’m missing out.
And what do you know? In my opinion, it is not as intimidating as some people make it out to be and I think you’ll not only enjoy it, but love it. I’ve been told that Gardens of the Moon is often thought of as the “weakest” in the series. If that’s the case, then I’m in for enjoying the rest of the series.
To be honest, I only experienced the “wow this is overwhelming” feeling that lots of people talk about when bringing up getting into the Malazan universe for about the first 50-100 pages. After that, the author does such an amazing job at placing clues, leading the reader where he wants them to go without holding their hand or spending 1,000 pages telling you about the world.

The world was rich. There were histories upon histories, incorporating beings of immense power. I felt that Erikson did a fantastic job at portraying the various power levels of individuals, explaining their weaknesses and still making you fell in complete awe at the creatures and beings that call this world their home. I just wanted more and more of the Lore. I want more information about the Bridgeburners, the magic system – warrens, on the different races such as the T’lan Imass and the Tiste Andii. I wanted a “guide” or something that I can take to work and read instead of doing real work.

I didn’t feel like there was a main character. This wasn’t the “coming of age” tale of some hero or the story of how a legend came to be, rather this was the story of the entire world and the pieces that came to play on it, all moved by their masters and the forces that willed them. Characters that you met were already who they had become, and I was able to easily understand and appreciate them without needing to be detailed their entire history.

The entire book felt fast-paced. Plots upon plots upon plots were woven as all of the puzzle pieces collided chapter after chapter. It was such an exciting writing style to be able to see all of your favorite characters converge together. Speaking of favorite characters, I have a lot of them.
Anomander Rake, Lord of Moon’s Spawn, Son of Darkness, Knight of Darkness.
I felt his power when reading of him. Erikson did an incredible job with all of his scenes and portraying such powerful characters. I could almost feel the pressure of the sword when looked upon, and hear the wagon and the chains. If there’s one character I want to read more and more about, it’s Rake.

Quick Ben
Probably the second character I want to know more about. Seven warrens can be used by him at one time and he is an ex-High Priest of Shadow? Where is this guy’s past and how do I get my hands on it? He was funny, exciting and powerful.

Whiskeyjack
Here is a man who has become so numb to death and killing that he no longer questions it. It’s always, I wouldn’t say fun, but interesting to read about characters like this and how they handle themselves. I would say that occasionally I thought of him as similar to how I felt about Dalinar in the Words of Radiance.

Paran
Paran’s story is probably the one you read about most, as he is in the beginning and you follow him throughout. I think it’s pretty awesome that he now carries Lorn’s Otataral sword and I hope to learn more about how the anti-magic works in future books.

Tattersail
“Tattersail smiled. “The only death I fear is dying ignorant.”
Holy crap. Did that really happen? Did she kill her body to and become a baby again? She is far more powerful than I thought she was initially and was very good at playing the part. Can’t wait to read more about what happened with her and if she will be reuinited with Paran.

There are dozens of others that I loved. Kalam (I want to see his anger unleashed), Sorry (What is going on with that witch inside?), Crokus (Tossing the coin in at the end was pretty awesome), Rallick (Otataral inside of his skin? How powerful is he now?), Tool (Lots of feeling and emotion for a supposed three hundred thousand year old creature), Toc (The scratchy eye and visions through the Warren? Where did you go my friend?), Lorn (I loved her chapters, though I am not “sad” to see her go. If she truly stays dead.)

And let’s not forget…

Kruppe!
I had mixed feelings about this guy. At first I couldn’t figure out who was playing who, but towards the end I started to see his real power and motives and ended up with positive feelings about the fat, dreaming bastard. His third person talking perspective is kind of annoying, but funny.

Gardens of the Moon is a great book that you will enjoy reading, as long as you like Swords and Sorcery style fantasy anyway. This is the type of fantasy I want to read. For some, it’ll be too demanding. I understand this. This book is not for everyone, but it most certainly is for me.
