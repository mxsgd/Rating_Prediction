"<i>This review is a copy of the transcript of my video review on <u><b><a href=""https://youtu.be/B6nnEOlZJSU"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Howling Dark.</a></b></u></i><br /><br /><b>Philosophical, bizarre, sprawling, and epic. <i>Howling Dark</i> outshined the already stunning <i>Empire of Silence</i>.</b><br /><br /><b>
  <blockquote>“The poets say that one’s fears grow less with trial, that we become men without fear if tried enough. I have not found it to be so. Rather, on each occasion we are tested, we become stronger than our fears. It is all we can do. Must do. Lest we perish for our failings.”</blockquote>
</b><br /><br />Loss.<br />I’m at a loss witnessing how proficient Christopher Ruocchio is in the art of storytelling. When I posted my review of <i>Empire of Silence</i> three weeks ago, many viewers of mine mentioned they’re confident I would love <i>Howling Dark</i> and the third book in the series, <i>Demon in White</i>, even more. Both <i>Howling Dark</i> and <i>Demon in White</i> are often deemed as the best volumes of the series. I was both excited and slightly unsure whether that would come to fruition. I loved <i>Empire of Silence</i> very much, and it instantly became an immediacy for me to read <i>Howling Dark</i> to find out whether it would surpass it. Also, before you ask me, I have read the short novel in-between first, <i>The Lesser Devil</i>, which, by the way, is an action-packed short novel that made me even more impatient to read <i>Howling Dark</i> because I miss reading Hadrian’s slow-burn narration. And a week after I finished reading <i>The Lesser Devil</i>, I read <i>Howling Dark</i>. Here we are. So... was it indeed a superior book compared to <i>Empire of Silence</i>? Unbelievably, I will have to concur. All of you were right about this. Again. And before this year is over, one of my goals is to read <i>Demon in White</i>. But before that, here is my review of <i>Howling Dark</i>.<br /><br /><b>
  <blockquote>“No, no. I only mean that you can be too free. That’s chaos. You have to have a goal to aim at and to orient yourself to. Imore says the properly lived life is one which draws the best path between that goal—who you could become—and who you are today, but that this is accomplished by sacrificing certain freedoms. By making choices.”</blockquote>
</b><br /><br /><i>Howling Dark</i> is the second novel in <i>The Sun Eater</i> series by Christopher Ruocchio, and it continues the chronicle of Hadrian Marlowe. But do not expect the story to begin directly after the ending of <i>Empire of Silence</i>. Hadrian is lost. For half a century, Hadrian has searched the farther suns for the lost planet of Vorgossos, hoping to find a way to contact the elusive alien Cielcin. He has not succeeded, and for years has wandered among the barbarian Normans as captain of a band of mercenaries: The Red Company. Determined to make peace and bring an end to nearly four hundred years of war, Hadrian must venture beyond the security of the Sollan Empire and among the Extrasolarians who dwell between the stars. If he succeeds, he will usher in a peace unlike any in recorded history. If he fails...the galaxy will burn. <br /><br /><b>
  <blockquote>“True lessons require not only knowing, but that the student practices his knowledge again and again. Thus knowledge becomes us, and we become more than the animal and the machine. That is why the best teachers are students always, and the best students are never fully educated. I had forgotten Gibson’s lesson for a moment, but stood a little straighter, shouldering as a pack my grief, my regret and self-loathing.”</blockquote>
</b><br /><br />Yes, the story in <i>Howling Dark</i> begins decades after the conclusion of <i>Empire of Silence</i>. With time jumps as relatively big as this, it can understandably take a while to get used to the reintroduction of Hadrian and his friends (both new and old) in a brand-new setting and storyline. Initially, there were a few moments in the first 100 pages where it felt like I missed reading a book, especially regarding Hadrian's relationship with a new character named Jinan. But rest assured, if you feel the same way I did, this is intentional. Maybe Ruocchio plans to fill the interval someday with a novella or two, but you have not missed reading a book. Ruocchio gradually fills in the details efficiently so readers can understand the key events within the time gap. And it did not take long for me to feel immersed in Ruocchio's exquisite writing again. Even though it has only been three weeks since I reviewed <i>Empire of Silence</i>, it felt good to be back with Hadrian, Valka, Bassander Lin, Switch, Pallino, and the world again.<br /><br /><b>
  <blockquote>“Were I still the boy I’d been, I would have said she owed me for my mercy. But mercy that expects repayment is no mercy at all, nor is a friendship truly a friendship that stands on debt and gratitude.”</blockquote>
</b><br /><br />Picture: Hadrian &amp; Valka<br />Ruocchio has built upon every groundwork established in <i>Empire of Silence</i>. We’re only two out of seven books into the series, but I can confidently say <i>The Sun Eater</i> series is already packed with characters that get under your skin. None of the characters ever felt like they behaved out of their personality, and the beautiful, wholesome, heartbreaking, and pulse-pounding scenes between Hadrian and the integral characters were palpable. In the first book, we see Hadrian’s moment of encounter with a few pivotal side characters like Valka, Switch, and Bassander Lin. The relationship between Hadrian and Valka was one of my favorite things about <i>Empire of Silence</i>, and I am pleased to say this trend perseveres in this book. I just loved reading about the slow-building chemistry they have with one another. But if I were asked which relationship development tugged at my heartstrings most in <i>Howling Dark</i>, my pick goes to Hadrian’s friendship with Switch. Their interaction and development made me emotional, simple as that. If you have read <i>Howling Dark</i>, you have the luxury of foresight to know what I'm talking about.<br /><br /><b>
  <blockquote>“Sad is like a big ocean, and you can’t breathe deep down. You can float on it, you can swim a little, but be careful. Grief is drowning. Grief is deep water.”</blockquote>
</b><br /><br />And then, there’s the rivalry with the Phoenix, Bassander Lin. A man who obeys every order and law, even against his own emotion. Bassander Lin was a character that did not have many spotlights in <i>Empire of Silence</i>, but the teasers Ruocchio included there ensured I should pay attention to this character, and in <i>Howling Dark</i>, it has paid off. And I have no doubt this notion will run through the rest of the series. Hadrian’s clash of morality and ideals with Bassander Lin is one of the finest aspects of the novel, and I loved everything about it. Additionally, there’s also the dispute against the Cielcin and the introduction of a new character I will not name—he’s the character on the front cover of <i>Howling Dark</i> illustrated by Kieran Yanner—that heightened the complexity and conflict of the series.<br /><br /><b>
  <blockquote>“A man is the sum of his memories—and more—he is the sum of all those others he has met, and what he learned from them. And that is an encouraging thought, for that knowledge and those memories survive and are part of us through every storm, and every little death.”</blockquote>
</b><br /><br />In a way, it can be argued that Ruocchio employed a similar storytelling and progression structure from <i>Empire of Silence</i> in <i>Howling Dark</i>. The first quarter of <i>Empire of Silence</i> was about introducing Hadrian and his family, and Hadrian eventually arrived at Borosevo. Most of the plotline in <i>Empire of Silence</i> took place in Borosevo. At the end of <i>Empire of Silence</i>, a negotiation or interrogation scene relying on the power of language and translation transpired. These are, more or less, the same in <i>Howling Dark</i>. <b>However, you would be sorely mistaken to think the similar story structure or progression entails duplicate content of its predecessor. <i>Howling Dark</i> is a different form of threatening beast</b>. <br /><br /><b>
  <blockquote>“Deep truths there may be, but none is deeper than this: Those lost to us do not return, nor the years turn back. Rather it is that we carry a piece of those lost to us within ourselves, or on our backs. Thus ghosts are real, and we never escape them.”</blockquote>
</b><br /><br />It is so bizarre at times, terrifying, ruthless, and undeniably more epic. Ruocchio vividly painted the oppressive darkness of space and space travel with his writing. Space travel and space opera are often depicted as glorious, but immersed in these great stories, I cannot shake the chilling fear of being lost in the infinite obsidian outside our dominion when I imagine space travel. This is one of many examples in <i>Howling Dark</i> regarding how Ruocchio wrote space opera series incredibly well in <i>Howling Dark</i>. Even the passage of time caused by the usage of fugue is not a trivial matter. And we haven't even accounted for the incomprehensible extraterrestrial creatures, like the Cielcin in this series, and the harrowing evil of both man and Cielcin into the equation.<br /><br /><b>
  <blockquote>“Evil is older than we, other than we—or is greater than, extending back and forward across all of conscious Time. Reader, there are other devils than Man. And by our evolved reason we may be sure of understanding human devils only.”</blockquote>
</b><br /><br />Following up on the lore and world-building teased in <i>Empire of Silence</i>, I absolutely enjoyed the expansion of the grandiose scope in <i>Howling Dark</i>. If you have read <i>Empire of Silence</i>, this should not come as a surprise. This is expected, and Ruocchio delivered. The world-building in <i>Howling Dark</i> is extraordinary and intricately designed. Without going into spoiler-territory, we learn more about the Golden Age of Earth, the Mericanii, daimons, androids, robots, and cyborgs of the series. These and the inclusion of the horror elements exponentially escalate the large-scale setting of <i>The Sun Eater</i> series while also making sure <i>Howling Dark</i> is a different book to <i>Empire of Silence</i>. As I said, <i>Howling Dark</i> contains many bizarre scenes. If you think you would succeed at predicting everything going on in <i>Howling Dark</i>, then I applaud your confidence.<br /><br /><b>
  <blockquote>“We believe our fear destroyed by new bravery. It is not. Fear is never destroyed. It is only made smaller by the courage we find after. It is always there.”</blockquote>
</b><br /><br />Journey before destination. The devil is in the details. We might have known that Hadrian would become The Sun Eater at the end of the series, but the flow and all the intricacies of Hadrian achieving his many titles remain unpredictable to me. And <i>Howling Dark</i> is another proof of why I am resilient in voicing my opinion that prophecies or visions are not detrimental to the storytelling quality in science fiction and fantasy. Same with every trope, it all depends on execution. How the author operates the tropes in their story matters the most. And in my opinion, the usage of visions in <i>Howling Dark</i> was total brilliance. The plot is unpredictable. The tone of the series is darker. The ugliness of the world does not fade. The mystery of The Quiet thickens with certainty. Hadrian will have to rely on his companions, hand-in-hand, to fight against the overpowering darkness and death. And I am excited to read further into the series.<br /><br /><b>
  <blockquote>“It is said that Death herself was present at the first summoning of that nuclear fire, and that she had smiled in her lipless way and pronounced that she was mighty then, mighty enough to destroy worlds and not only nations. The magi who had summoned her quailed, and wrung their hands, and wept for the evil they had done, but did it all the same—for ever are magi so consumed by the question of whether a thing can be done that they ignore the matter of whether or not it should until it is too late, being the sort who sells his soul for knowledge, forgetting it is the soul which craves that knowledge in the first place and makes life worth living.”</blockquote>
</b><br /><br />From cover to cover, <i>Howling Dark</i> hooked and impressed me. Each page, each paragraph, and each chapter only gets better and better. And let me tell you this: the page-turning slow-burn narrative in <i>Howling Dark</i> has an unquestionably explosive payoff. This is a magnificent example of a large-scale space opera series done right. If you read <i>Empire of Silence</i> and expect battle-filled concluding chapters, you will get what you seek in <i>Howling Dark</i>. The last 100 pages of this novel were utterly breathtaking and intense. I did not expect the series to reach this level of intensified carnage and high-stakes dialogues, not this soon, and I am grateful for it.<br /><br /><b>
  <blockquote>“The greater part of war, I think, is such forgotten acts of heroism. You sing your songs of Hadrian Halfmortal, of the Phoenix of Perfugium, of other heroes, but I tell you we are nothing, nothing next to those ordinary men who lay down their lives—who are not ordinary at all.”</blockquote>
</b><br /><br />I read the 100 pages long climax sequences of <i>Howling Dark</i> in one sitting. It was impossible to put down. The instrumental negotiations and unrelenting chaos imbued with twists and turns were superbly engaging. The glowing shard of ice of the highmatter swords acted as a command of control in the stained red and black encapsulated domain. Will the swordsman or the poet triumph as the orators in the inevitable traversal of madness brimming with harsh decisions, treasons, horror, cruelty, and violence? Read and find out for yourself. But as all hell breaks loose in the Demonic’s dreadnought, we readers will witness the details of the birth of one of Hadrian’s many titles. And as if seeing clearly through the eyes of the characters in <i>The Sun Eater</i>, I do not think I will ever forget this iconic scene penned in <i>Howling Dark</i>.<br /><br /><b>
  <blockquote>“The answer was within. Within the structure of literature, of art and meaning that we humans had raised about ourselves like an ark, a curtain wall to block out the waters of chaos and the world. That is why we pray, why we build great temples and write great books: to ask great questions and to live—not by the answers, for such questions are unanswerable—but by the noble process of seeking those answers, that we might stand tall and struggle on.”</blockquote>
</b><br /><br />Love.<br />“To love is in part the attempt to become a creature worthy of love.” Amidst the darkness, war, brutality, and violence, I believe <i>Howling Dark</i> is, at its core, a story about love, loyalty, friendship, duty, choices, hope, and seeking peace. Light cannot exist without darkness, and vice versa, after all. To wrap this review up, <i>Howling Dark</i> is simply one of the best sci-fi novels written and published. I loved everything about it immensely. I already adored <i>Empire of Silence</i>, and somehow, Ruocchio managed to turn <i>Howling Dark</i> into a greater volume. My addiction to <i>The Sun Eater</i> has grown stronger. And although I am only two books into the series, <i>The Sun Eater</i> has become one of my favorite ongoing series. And the ending of <i>Howling Dark</i> was tremendously satisfying. Hadrian's journey toward Gododin, toward light and fire, is one step closer. My list of books to read is not getting shorter, but I don't feel burdened in making the chronicle of Hadrian Marlowe one of my paramount series to read. Ruocchio is two-for-two now. I will read <i>Demon in White</i> soon and find out whether Ruocchio will achieve a hattrick of favorite books on my list with the first three novels of <i>The Sun Eater</i> series.<br /><br /><b>
  <blockquote>“ We are not always the authors of our own stories. Some of us never are. I think that is what we struggle for: the command of our own lives. We struggle against our families, against the state, against nature, against our own weakness. All that we might choose for ourselves, if only for a moment.”</blockquote>

"What to even say about this book, holy shit. Hands down the best science fiction book that I've read this year and if I hadn't already read Royal Assassin it would also be the best fantasy book I've read this year. Empire of Silence was already an incredible start to this wonderful series and Howling Dark was better in every conceivable way. I have nothing but praise for this book and series so far and from what I hear, Demon in White is EVEN better. <br /><br />Everything from the characters, to the twists, the pacing, the prose, just...everything. This is the exact type of book for me and it was fucking great. Go read Sun Eater, immediately. ",5
"Howling Dark, the second book in Ruocchio's Sun Eater Science Fiction series, is a lengthy epic fantasy novel set in outer space that will take some time to read, but is well worth the epic effort. It postulates a future where mankind has spread among the stars, mainly locked into a feudal empire with titles and an imperial emperor whose line stretches back millenium to Earth. <br /><br />But the universe is big and there are others out there and mankind has now met a foe worthy of respect, a foe which swallows planets like nothing and has no understanding of the terms of peace, parley, or ambassadors - a race warlike and which towers over mere mortals. Hadrian and a band of mercenaries are seeking a way to find a secret planet - so secret no one knows where it is - and perhaps an emissary like no other who can deal with the alien race - the Cielcin . You know, someone who can make an introduction that could perhaps lead to a peace treaty. <br /><br />But, this secret planet is like no other and is like perhaps all of Dante's circles of hell and is ruled by an undying man who rumour has it has lived for 15,000 years and possesses terrible secrets. It is an amazing plot which only unfolds slowly. It is unnecessary to begin with book one in the series, although perhaps that would be helpful. <br /><br />This book has a universe like that in Dune, filled with all manner of aliens and a multitude of planets spread out so far from Earth that it is barely remembered in legend. There is swordplay aplenty and amazing battles. There is a chess game and a game within a game that will result in surprises for the reader. There is an endless battle between humanity and artificial intelligence and questions about what it means to be human after 15,000 years of life, what it means to be human when clones can be manufactured that seem so human. How much can you alter and replace and still be a person rather than a machine. There is also a mysticism that elevates the story. <br /><br />Prepare to be astonished by the way things develop. A lengthy read to be sure, but one that is epic in its reach.",5
"I am a believer. Ruocchio is the man. <br /><br />""True lessons require not only knowing, but that the student practices his knowledge again and again. Thus knowledge becomes us, and we become more than the animal and the machine. That is why the best teachers are students always, and the best students are never fully educated."" <br /><br />I'm going to tell you up front - this is my new favorite sci-fi novel! <br /><br />I really enjoyed Empire of Silence, the first book in the Sun Eater series. Ruocchio's prose was fantastic, the character of Hadrian was dynamic and complex, and the world was interesting. Not to mention the hook- Hadrian would one day blow up a sun and kill billions 👀😱 EoS followed Hadrian's early formative years, and because of that, and it being a debut, it had rocky pacing. It felt like a series of things happening instead of a cohesive narrative. <br /><br />But Howling Dark is a wild ride! For the first half, I admit, I didn't see what the hype was. The book was good! It was better than EoS. But it wasn't blowing me away. But around the halfway mark, the novel gets to a particular location and after it gets there, this book is just crazy detail after explosive reveal after insane event until the jaw-dropping, end of my seat conclusion of the book. I read about 40% of this book in an evening, just glued to my audiobook and my physical book whenever possible. There are so many plot details I can't mention, but one thing I really love about this series is how thought out the worldbuilding is, and how thought provoking the prose is. Ruocchio makes you consider humanity, religion, philosophy, culture, and war with nearly every chapter. What would you do, in Hadrian's shoes? It's hard to know.<br /><br />Hadrian is one of my favorite characters to read about. Ruocchio's prose and storytelling is second to none. This is the space opera, sci-fantasy epic that we needed. I have already finished the short story collection and will be moving onto Demon in White as soon as possible! <br /><br />Ruocchio writes like a machine, so if you are hesitant to jump into an unfinished series, it seems like it will be completed in the near future, so I would not hesitant! <br /><br />10/10",5
An incredible roller coaster ride of a book. More people need to read this series!,5
"2.5 stars<br /><br />The first 1/3 or so is a slog. There are so many references to events that apparently happened after the first book, <a href=""https://goodreads.com/book/show/36454667.Empire_of_Silence__Sun_Eater___1_"" title=""Empire of Silence (Sun Eater, #1) by Christopher Ruocchio"" rel=""noopener"">Empire of Silence</a>, and before the start of this one. Half the time I had no idea what was going on and felt like there must have been a book I missed (there wasn't).<br /><br />The second 1/3 was in a word, boring. There is just no other way to describe it. The characters are stuck in a place called Vorgossos for what feels like Forever (and yes, the word must be capitalized). Pages and chapters of existential angst, inner musing, and meaningless idle conversation.<br /><br />In the last 1/3 the characters finally leave Vorgossos! At this point in the book I definitely felt some fleeting excitement. This is where basically all the action in the book takes place, but honestly, it wasn't enough to rescue the book as a whole.<br /><br />Overall, not as good as the first book, and reading it felt the way the final few kilometres of a marathon must for the poor person struggling to finish and who wonders, ""Why did I ever start this, and when will it end?"" <br /><br />2.5 stars as is, but could possibly have been a full 3 stars had it been cut by 50%. In this case 832 pages is about 400 pages too many.<br /><br /><i>A man is the sum of his memories - and more - he is the sum of all those others he has met, and what he has learned from them. And that is an encouraging thought, for that knowledge and those memories survive and are part of us through every storm, and every little death.</i>",3
Brilliant. Even better than book one. This is a new favorite series for sure.,5
"Re-read Update: There isn't much more to add. This is an amazing book. It was even better on a re-read. There is so much well executed foreshadowing in addition to all of the incredible characters, settings, action, plot, and lore that I loved the first time. This is where the series really becomes something special. This is an all time favorite. <br /><br /><br /><br />When I read Sun Eater book 1, Empire of Silence, last Fall I did so because I heard about the book via Mike's Book Reviews channel on You Tube. Before that I don't think I had ever even heard of it. I might have saw them on the shelves at Barnes and Noble, but they never registered with me as something I noticed let alone something I'd want to read. After reading Empire of Silence I quickly realized how much I had been missing out on a great series. Book 2, Howling Dark, only further cemented that feeling as it is now one of my absolute favorite sci fi series, and it is in fact probably the best sci fi series you are not reading. <br /><br />Honestly, Howling Dark begins somewhat unusually. Even if you read this right after finishing Empire of Silence there is a good chance that you may start out a bit lost or confused. Did you miss a book, a short story, or novella that took place in between? No you didn't, but Howling Dark takes place after a somewhat significant time skip in the series. Some of that passes while characters are in ""space sleep"" traveling between worlds, but it's also clear some action has occurred off page and there are some new characters and relationships that the reader is unaware of but are not new to the characters. This didn't really bother me because I just assumed it was off page, and that as this story started I would get filled in on what I needed to know and that was the case. And it doesn't take long for this book's plot to start going picking up more or less where book 1 left off in terms of the mission Hadrian is on.<br /><br />Further discussion of plot elements would probably lead to spoilers so I'll avoid those while talking about what I loved about this book. First of all there is the writing. Typically, the writing in a book isn't something I notice very much unless it is particularly bad or particularly good. In this case I noticed it because the prose of Christopher Ruocchio is absolutely phenomenal. There are certain sentences crafted so well here I would just put the book down and stop for a moment to absorb them. I kept telling people I wish I was reading this as an ebook instead of a physical copy so I could have highlighted all of the phenomenal passages. I would put his writing on a level of the best authors of sci fi and fantasy. <br /><br />Besides the writing itself I was captivated by both this book's plot and themes. Whereas, Empire of Silence spent a lot of time establishing Hadrian as a character and showing us the trials and tribulations he went through to be where and what he is, Howling Dark really starts to be the real story beyond the character origins. We are introduced to many new story elements, characters, and new mysterious happenings that it really increased my investment in the story and world. As for the themes they really start to show through in Howling Dark as well. For starters, how likely is it for peace to even be possible between two warring races from such vastly different cultures that one of them doesn't even have a word for ""peace"" in their language only ""submission""? The answer is explored here and drives the story, and you get a sense of how we might be headed down the path where the series is destined to end. Of course there are other themes as well such as the nature of humanity, and what it means to live and die when there are beings 15,000 years old or more.<br /><br />Beyond the brain breaking stuff (which I love and of which there is plenty) there is also quite a bit of good popcorn action entertainment especially in the later 1/3 of the book. We get to see up close and personal what the frenzy of combat looks like in this universe and we get some pretty heart pounding sequences to show us. This isn't a book I would read for the action, but if you like that sort of thing along with the other stuff it's definitely here to keep the pages turning at the end.<br /><br />If I had one minor criticism it's that I still don't know if I'm sold on the main character of the series. I like him well enough, and I like reading what happens to and around him. However, as far as pure characterization goes I like a lot of the side characters quite a bit more. Seeing as this isn't as much of a character driven narrative I don't find this to really effect my enjoyment of the series.<br /><br />In the end if you like epic adventures, aliens, futuristic technologies, mysterious happenings, space travel, and great writing you owe it to yourself to check this series out. It deserves to have more eyeballs on it. It's a hidden gem among sci fi literature.",5
"Howling dark is an absolute work of art! It takes everything that was good in EoS and perfects it. The prose is top tier, the pacing is phenomenal and the story is fresh and constantly engaging. I was unable to predict any twists and I was constantly kept guessing. <br /><br />This is everything I wanted Red Rising to be. I wish I had read this sooner!!! There are no real critiques that I have for this story. If you give me a microphone and a soap box I will sing it’s praises to any who will listen. <br /><br />Christopher Ruocchio takes the prose and cadence style of Pat Rothfuss, the character depth of Robin Hobb and the action of Pierce brown and blends it into a tale that will delight readers for years to come. 5/5",5
"<blockquote>
  <i>""We believe our civilization the product of our struggles when in truth we are its products. We are its children, raised behind walls.""</i>
</blockquote><br />Howling Dark is a fantastic sequel to Empire of Silence, and this series is on its way to becoming one of my favourites if the subsequent entries are as good as this one was. I had been informed that this book was a large improvement over the previous one but I didn't realize how much better it was in almost every aspect until I read it.<br /><br />Ruocchio's writing is smooth and reads effortlessly. The descriptions of the Dark, the alien Cielcin, the planets, the machines along with the ethereal feeling of the many visions and otherworldly sequences were captivating and lent to the book being very atmospheric. Every location felt distinct and memorable. The action and battle scenes were also very well-written and had a sense of danger and urgency. The pacing is excellent, being much improved from the meandering pace of the first book. Even in its slower and reflective moments, there is a constant tension that drives the book forward.<br /><blockquote>
  <i>""The ugliness of the world does not fade, and fear and grief are not made less by time. We are only made stronger. We can only float together on their tides, as otters do, hand in hand.”</i>
</blockquote><br />Hadrian's character continues to grow and change, there are times where glimpses are seen of the Hadrian he will eventually become. The side characters such as Pallino, Valka, Lin, and others have distinct voices and personalities; the few new characters that are introduced are also quite interesting and have an imposing presence on-page. They play off each other very well and the different relationships Hadrian forms with each of them play a major role in the story.<br /><br />The worldbuilding is organically expanded and has some intriguing mysteries that form the backbone of the story, besides the main plot involving the lost planet and the Cielcin. The incorporation of various sci-fi elements like Artificial Intelligences, genetic manipulation, terrible machines into this universe's lore and the part they play was very interesting to read; I am partial to stories that involve mysterious civilizations and ancient history that the characters slowly have to uncover and piece together and this book had a lot of that.<br /><blockquote>
  <i>""Our swords shall play the orators for us.""</i>
</blockquote><br />The Cielcin was another aspect that I enjoyed — the portrayal of a truly alien culture, showing the impassable gulf between the two species due to their fundamental differences in wiring and how even their language differs in subtext and meaning was exceptionally well-done. It was fascinating to read about the communication barrier causing an irrevocable chasm between them. They are so other to humanity that ascribing human ways of thinking and logic to them is nigh impossible.<br /><br />The only somewhat major gripe I had was in the first 15-20% of the book. Due to there being a time skip between the end of the first book and the start of this one, it felt like I missed a whole chapter in the story. I don't usually have an issue with time skips but it felt jarring in this case specifically because some of the initial chapters relied on emotional beats involving a few new side characters and those did not land for me. It took me a while to get invested but once that initial speedbump was crossed, the rest of the book was enthralling. Overall, a great sequel in every aspect and I can't wait to get to the third one, especially given how this book ended.",5
"The most Common criticism I see of Empire of Silence is that it is derivative of other books.<br />I don't agree, but I understand where people are coming from. Howling Dark is not only not particularly derivative, Howling Dark is one of the most unique reading experiences I have ever had.<br /><br /><br />Obviously I cannot go into details, but the story of this book is unlike anything I have read, Vorgossos is an insanely unique setting, the way conflicts develop is not like anything I have read.<br /><br />If you are not sure whether you should read this, and the main reason was originality in Empire of Silence, then I cannot say this enough. READ IT.<br /><br />Anyway, Ruocchio is still a damm amazing writer, and he truly wrote the shit out of this book. Fantastic characters, including a minor antagonist that he managed to make me despise and respect. Descriptions and atmosphere that makes you feel the emptiness of space, a crazy ending, and some truly wild and out of this world content.<br /><br /><br />The closest thing I have for a criticisms of this book is just that it took a bit to get into what I consider the real plot of this book, and the emphasis on one side character from book 1 after the time skip came a little out of left field.<br /><br />9.2/10",5
"Updated review:<br /><br />I know what I’ve said about Empire of Silence being incredible on a re-read, and I want to triple that for Howling Dark. <br /><br />The foreshadowing is unreal, the emotions hit harder, the story itself appears completely different as you the reader reads it from the vantage of Narrator Hadrian vs. the man’s younger counterpart. And everything works so well.<br /><br />Once I picked this back up I decided to buckle down and finish my re-read before October, and somehow managed to do so, and look much forward to doing the short story collections and novellas next. <br /><br />Friendly reminder: Read Sun Eater. <br /><br /><br />Original:<br /><br />""Ruocchio finna give an aneurysm: the novel.""<br /><br />For real tho, if EoS was any good, this thing blows it out of the water.<br /><br />Not a single wasted paragraph, let alone page. <br /><br />What a wonderfully horrific book.",5
"This was a solid 4 for most of my time with it, but the last 25-30% is a hell of a ride and bumps this to a 4.5 I think.<br />Wow, so I wrapped this up, and my brain is still processing. Lots to unpack, and I feel like this will be a book that I'll think about for a while. I'm newer to the SciFi genre, but I can tell this is some of the best it might have to offer. If you haven't check out the Sun Eater series by Christopher Ruocchio, do yourself the favour.<br /><br />Complex, flawed, compelling characters ✔️<br /><br />Expansive world rich in lore ✔️<br /><br />Beautiful Prose with philosophy woven in the best way ✔️<br /><br />Strong Plot ✔️<br /><br />Decent Pacing for an ambitious story like this ✔️<br /><br />Ridiculous, jaw-dropping last 25% that makes the ride extra worthwhile ✔️<br /><br />Check out my Booktube channel: Rekindled Reader",4
<b>3.0 Stars</b><br />I struggled to get immersed in this second installment of the Suneater series. I want to love this series but this second volume failed to pull me in. I am interested to see if the next book will pull me back into the story. ,3
This series is incredible. It is ridiculous that this isn’t vastly more popular than Red Rising. This surpasses that series in almost every fathomable way. The prose is very good. The action is bloody and graphic. The characters are well developed. The world building is rich and well thought out. I can not wait to read more of this series. <br /><br />It took me a minute to get into the groove of this book and I have no idea why but something just sparked and I couldn’t stop reading. Read this series people!!,5
"An incredible sequel to <i>Empire of Silence</i>!! I love it when a book goes in an unexpected direction! <br /><br />The first half was good, but had its slower moments and dragged a tiny bit. Once I got to the second half, though, the book became unputdownable. And then the ending - I have so many questions!! Can't wait to continue my journey with <i>Demon in White</i>.<br />",5
"Disclosure: I received a review copy from the publisher in exchange for a honest review.<br /><br />Empire of Silence burst onto the Sci-Fi scene with its intimidating, wallop of a book that was big enough to be classified as a deadly weapon. But thankfully, I didn’t fall victim or let it deter me from tackling the mammoth book which took me on a crazy and poignant galactic adventure beyond the cosmos, telling the story of the would-be infamous hero, destroyer, murderer; Hadrian Marlowe. In the sequel, Howling Dark, Ruocchio continues Marlowe’s story as we see bit by bit of the man he’s to become. Howling Dark picks up exactly where we left off (technically give or take a few years with people in and out of fugue) with Hadrian, Legion officials, for-hire mercenaries and his mrymidon friends as they search for the legendary planet Vorgossos and a way to broker a peace treaty with the Cielcin.<br /><br />Hadrian has come a long way since the first book. We’ve seen him as a student, son, beggar, slave, and a fighter. In Howling Dark, he continues his ascent (or as Hadrian would tell you his descent) as a leader and savior to his people but an immortal killer to his foes. Without giving away too much of the novel, I will say that the team succeeded in finding the lost planet of Vorgossos. Vorgossos is the stuff of legends, the scary stories told to terrify you…but what was even more unbelievable was finding the person in charge, who is also made of legends. It was all quite fitting actually.<br /><br />I thought this book was a lot darker than its predecessor, which wasn’t a problem or a surprise considering all the events that led them on this quest. Ruocchio expands on the universe as we explore new territories and meet other beings, even A.Is. The majority of the key characters we’ve met from the previous novel are all back and we definitely got a more in-depth look to them, and the different facets of their being. However, I must warn you now dear readers, that with all war, there are casualties and Ruocchio spares no one this time around. A favorite character of mine met their demise early on in the book. It’s all very sad and bloody.<br /><br />On a happier note, I am absolutely loving everything that Ruocchio is creating. The characters are multifaceted, complex, realistic and utterly flawed. The best example of this is our main protagonist Hadrian. He has experienced, seen, and lived so many lives beyond those of his regular peerage all while trying to balance that fine line between good and evil; doing what he believes is right and at the same time do what is needed. Although, I wonder if Hadrian isn’t confusing the two…right-needed. There was a pivotal scene towards the end that determined how everything was going to play out and the choice that Hadrian made was pretty drastic and I wondered if it was truly necessary? He later expressed his regrets but I’m not sure if it was genuine. That kind of threw me off, but overall I can’t help but like him.<br /><br />I also appreciate and enjoy the well-developed and detailed world building. Normally, with the scope of this novel and length of book, things can get a little muddled but you won’t find that issue here. Ruocchio painstakingly writes every minute detail down to the five senses and describes an array of emotions. I can vividly picture everything like a movie in my head from House Marlowe’s insignia dancing devil in black and red, the homunculus receptionist on March station down to the wondrous gardens of Vorgossos.<br /><br />Howling Dark is pretty damn perfect. There’s honestly nothing bad that I can say about this novel. It is a worthy sequel to last’s year successful debut, Empire of Silence and the series deserves all the accolades and more. You won’t find a sophomore slump here. If you’re wondering; Is the buzz real? Yes. Is Howling Dark better than the first book? Yes. Should I wait till the author publishes more books before I make a commitment? Hell no. Get on the Sun Eater bus A.S.A.P. Like I said, I loved it and hope more readers will discover this series...y'all don’t know what you’re missing!<br />In the meantime, the tortuous wait begins for the third book’s release, Demon in White’s.<br />",5
"IT's been a while since I've given anything five stars. But this is bravura storytelling people. No, it's not perfect. Ruocchio has a few writing tics that are distracting, and I still just don't get the Hadrian/ Valka romance at all. But that's not important. What is? It's hard to be surprised these days with anything coming out in publishing. Well, this surprised me. If book 1 was formulaic, but fresh (until it got bogged down in an interminable middle), this is like nothing I've read in a long time. I think using Dante's Inferno as inspiration is absolutely brilliant, and it works. <br /><br />The moment we meet the painted man, we know we're not in Kansas any more. And from there, it's a non-ending journey into the deepest circles of the hell of the dark cosmos that is frightening, exciting, but ultimately hopeful. And Hadrian, for all his whining, is a compelling character, especially whenever his old self comes out. I have no idea where this is going, and you can't imagine how excited that makes me. <br /><br />I'll be talking about this book on my youtube channel soon, if you're into that. so check it out. ",5

"<b>The price of life is death. With what will you pay, Halfmortal?<br /></b><br />I was utterly confused by the start of this book and had to check numerous times I was actually reading book two. <br />The story does not begin directly after the ending of Empire of Silence. <br />For 48 years, Hadrian has searched for the lost planet of Vorgossos, hoping to find the Cielcin. To achieve this, he has become the captain of a band of mercenaries: The Red Company, spending years in and out of fugue - space sleep. <br /><br /><b>The reedy youth from Delos was gone, burned out by the ragged piece of gutter trash I had become, by the myrmidon I had made of myself, the courtier- prisoner, the Cielcin translator, and the Lord Commandant of the Meidua Red Company.</b><br /><br />Hadrian quickly realises inside the empire, he was protected; walled up. Now, he’s facing the true unknown outside of control. <br />This is a story with a much more intimate cast with deeply resonant moments which define their paths and futures. And who is Hadrian to decide what their choices may entail? For themselves and the universe at large. <br /><br /><b>”This isn't one of your stories. You're not some sort of hero. The Empire's fate is not in your hands. This is not a play.<br /></b><br />Again, this was simply stunning. <br />This time, the discussions were more focused on what makes us human. Is it our blood that makes us human? Our bodies? Our genes, intellect, history? <br />This is so mind-boggling intelligent and speculative that I am in absolute awe.<br /><br /><b>But we are not bodies. We have bodies.<br />I can think of no greater evil than the insistence that we are only meat. How many lives have been demeaned —destroyed—by that insistence?<br /></b><br />At the 50% mark, things get decidedly weirder which is why my rating is lower.<br />It felt like some bizarre dream, or a sequence from <i>Revelations</i>. I think the story lost me a bit there. <br /><br />However, we do see Hadrian reach his dream and what he has been striving all his life to see, what he feels his entire potential has set him up for. <br />Yet, Ruocchio is a master at showcasing Hadrian’s frustration at the inability of species to communicate, to collaborate, to go past their differences and reach an understanding. <br />This is confounded by such contrasting natures and beliefs that 1+1=2 cannot be reconciled, to borrow his own allegory. <br />Each using words the other party do not fully understand, forming a dissonance between interpretations of the dialogue that only Hadrian seems aware of. <br /><br />Not to mention, I find it so cool - yes, that’s the word I’m using - the way Ruocchio uses our own current present history as stories and legends for these futuristic Roman-esque sci fi characters. <br /><br />Again, maybe I’m geeking out over these aspects more than others might, but I just find it genius!<br /><br /><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/booksblabbering/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Bookstagram</a>",4
"Howling Dark, the second entry in the Sun Eater epic science fantasy series, is a step up from its predecessor in almost every way, and has been almost unanimously praised by everyone I know who's read it. So the fact that it left me with somewhat mixed feelings is probably a sign that I should give up on this series. In this review I want to talk about what did and didn't work for me to try and figure out exactly why I feel the way I feel.<br /><br />Before you proceed, I will try to avoid spoilers in this review but it's impossible for me to say what I want to say without spoiling anything whatsoever, so if you haven't read the book then proceed with caution.<br /><br /><b>Prose</b><br /><br />That's right, I'm one of those people. Prose matters to me. That doesn't mean I can't enjoy a book without top-tier prose, but it's something I usually pay attention to and it does affect my experience. I specifically want to talk about the prose in Howling Dark because it's something I've seen repeatedly praised in reviews for this series, so I went in with pretty high expectations. Although this book was certainly written with great care taken for word choice and sentence structure, there were a couple of things that didn't work for me in the writing style.<br /><br />Firstly, Sun Eater is framed as being the memoir of Hadrian Marlowe, our main character, so why do I feel like there's a tonal mismatch between the dialogue and the prose? The prose is written in an elevated style reminiscent of the epic fantasy genre, for example look at this sentence:<br /><br /><blockquote>""How I'd seen it I cannot say, so remote was it, as an insect atop a distant hill.""</blockquote><br /><br />However the dialogue is all in plain American English - no one is talking like they're in Lord of the Rings. Immediately before this book I read another first person book, Project Hail Mary. Although not one of the best-written books I've ever read it's a useful counterexample for this situation because the tone of the prose absolutely does match the tone of the main character's dialogue - he writes pretty much exactly the way he speaks. The tonal dissonance in Howling Dark ended up making the ""elevated"" style feel more like an affectation than someting Hadrian would write sincerely.<br /><br />Secondly, I found the book to be terribly overwritten. I saw one review that compared Ruocchio's prose to Ursula Le Guin and I couldn't disagree more - say one thing for Le Guin she knows the value of brevity! I don't think I've read a single Le Guin book that reached the 400 page mark, meanwhile Howling Dark weighs in at around 750 pages. Does Howling Dark justify this length? In my opinion no, this story could easily have been told in 500 pages.<br /><br />The scenes I felt this in the most were dialogue and action scenes - there would be constant pauses and interruptions where Hadrian would spend a paragraph describing a character's posture, or something he was reminded of. I frequently found myself having to go back and reread the previous line of dialogue because by the time one character got round to answering the other I'd forgotten what they were even talking about! This was even more frustrating in action scenes where I would just want to find out what happens next but first I'd need to read a paragraph of melodramatic descriptions of the exact emotion Hadrian was feeling during that milisecond of the battle.<br /><br />Finally, by the end I had grown weary of Ruocchio's way of structuring paragraphs. It felt like he wanted to emphasise how profound a thought or moment was, so he had this habit of following up a long paragraph with a short, single-sentence paragraph, usually only 2-5 words long. As a writing technique there's nothing wrong with this, so long as it's not overused... Near the end of the book I encountered 5 such paragraphs within the span of a single page. If you try to make everything you say dramatic and profound then it ends up losing its impact somewhat.<br /><br /><b>Theme</b><br /><br />Howling Dark is a book with a lot of meaty thematic content to chew on, including whether it's okay to sacrifice a smaller number of people to save a greater number (the ol' trolley problem), the ethics of cloning and genetic modification, as well as other types of body-modification (the Ship of Theseus thought experiment applied to the human body), freedom vs duty and much more. This was great! I'm a very theme-driven reader and this was the area I think the book delivered on best.<br /><br />These themes have of course been tackled many times in other sci-fi books, some of which I've read, but it's always nice to read a fresh take on them. Unfortunately the part that detracted from this element of the book was that all of the thematic discussion is filtered through Hadrian's perspective - he's the one giving his opinions on these issues, and to be frank I found him and his opinions quite obnoxious. This could have been a nice opportunity for thoughtful discussion if he'd been surrounded by characters offering an alternative point of view, but more often than not this wasn't the case - either Hadrian would give his take and we'd leave it at that, or another character would offer a token disagreement but wouldn't dig any deeper into the issue.<br /><br />There was also the fact that the narrative itself, outside of Hadrian's perspective, offered a fairly one-sided view on some of these issues. We spend the lion's share of the story in close contact with Extrasolarians, a people who engage in heavy body-modification, behaviour that is strictly forbidden within Hadrian's society and which he has been raised to consider repulsive. From the outset Hadrian describes these people as evil and nefarious, and I kept waiting for the narrative to challenge that preconception... and I ended up waiting the entire damn book because not only is this never challenged (outside of a token ""hey, you know I also have implants?"" from Valka) it's repeatedly validated as every major Extrasolarian character Hadrian meets is an evil piece of shit.<br /><br />I'm self-aware enough to know that I'm showing my biases here - I'm perfectly happy for an author (<i>cough</i>Iain Banks<i>cough</i>) to present a one-sided world view provided it's one I agree with! Is that hypocritical? Perhaps. I'm not opposed to reading stories told from a conservative point of view, but if you're going to offer an opposing opinion I at least want it to be in opposition to something I actually agree with, not some cartoon villain version of the other side. But since we're talking about Hadrian's point of view that brings me neatly on to...<br /><br /><b>Character</b><br /><br />Perhaps the most important issue in regards to its impact on my enjoyment of the story. If I'm gonna spend thousands of pages reading a series I want to be spending time with characters I enjoy reading about and that's where this book was a real miss for me. The fact is, this is Hadrian's story, his memoir. His is the only POV we're gonna get outside of the supplementary novellas, so you have to <i>really</i> be on board with being in his head. And I'm just not.<br /><br />Ruocchio's elevator pitch for this series is ""What if Anakin Skywalker becoming Darth Vader was the right thing to do?"" - an intriguing pitch to be sure! The issue is, knowing that this is supposed to be a villain arc culminating in a genocide, I'm not sure if I'm supposed to be rooting for Hadrian or not. I certainly didn't feel like rooting for him in this book!<br /><br />His motivation of wanting to make peace with the Cielcin is a noble one that's easy to get behind, but I found myself questioning at many points during the book ""Is Hadrian really the best person for this job?"" I would consider empathy and compassion to be crucial qualities for any ambassador for peace, and I found Hadrian distinctly lacking in these qualities given his extreme prejudice against the Extrasolarians - if you can't even relate to humans who have a different philosophy from you then how do you expect to bridge the gap between humanity and an alien species? It takes much more than simply bridging the language gap - you need to develop a deep cultural understanding if you want to make any kind of lasting agreement with them.<br /><br />Of course, Hadrian being the wrong person for this job could be the entire point of the story, but if that was meant to be the case it didn't exactly come across that way. It's difficult to talk about this without spoilers but suffice to say that Hadrian's lack of empathy and compassion isn't reflected on by the older Hadrian who's telling the story, nor is it mentioned by any other characters. As such it felt to me less like a deliberate choice on the part of the author and more like we're actually supposed to agree with his prejudices.<br /><br />Having a less-than-likeable main character could be acceptable if, as in the Farseer books by Robin Hobb, he was backed up by a well-fleshed-out cast of side characters. Unfortunately I didn't find that to be the case either. That's not to say that the side characters are bad or anything, they're just quite average. Bassander Lin is fun to hate, Valka is somewhat likeable but since she's the character that most represents the ""sane"" point of view (being from outside the Empire) I found myself wishing she'd challenge Hadrian more often. Switch, Ghen, Pallino and the rest of the gang were all fine but none will enter my ""best characters of all time"" list.<br /><br /><b>Plot</b><br /><br />The plot was certainly the highlight of this book! I enjoyed the twists and turns, the interesting locations we got taken to, the mysterious characters we met and the answers we got to certain mysteries (that only led to other, deeper mysteries...) - it was all good stuff! As mentioned in the prose section I did find the pacing dragging from time to time, but otherwise I had a great time with the plot. No notes.<br /><br /><b>Worldbuilding</b><br /><br />This is a series with a very well-thought-out world. You can tell this is an aspect of storytelling Ruocchio enjoys and he does a great job of conveying the breadth and depth of the universe he's crafted. There were a couple of times where I found myself thinking about an aspect of the worldbuilding and thinking ""hmmm, this doesn't quite add up"" only for the book to point out that it didn't add up and there was a reason for that, so hats off to the author for anticipating my complaints there!<br /><br />If I can nitpick for a moment (and as you can tell by the length of this review, I do love to nitpick) I found there to be a few too many references to ancient Earth history, be it classic literature or ancient history. This series is set tens of thousands of years in the future. How many people do you know with names that date back tens of thousands of years? I understand wanting to ground your readers in something familiar but I'd expect more references to culture, philosophy and history from the intervening millenia. If fantasy series set in entirely fictional worlds can manage this I see no reason why it can't be done in a universe set in our distant future.<br /><br /><b>Genre</b><br /><br />This is a slightly odd category to bring up in a review but I wanted to mention it because I feel that it's relevant to my feelings on the book. Sun Eater is marketed as a science fantasy series, existing at the intersection between epic fantasy and science fiction. I feel that this is an apt description, as although it doesn't contain any overtly/explicitly magical elements it does contain many of the trappings of epic fantasy - the scope, the tone of the prose, the feudal society, even a bit of a ""chosen one/prophecy"" trope and the fatalistic nature of the story.<br /><br />I read a lot of fantasy and I read a lot of sci-fi, safe to say that these are my two favourite genres, so this combination should have been a slam dunk for me. The thing is, when I read a fantasy book I have a different set of expectations to when I read a sci-fi book - I enjoy both genres but they're scratching different itches. Somehow Sun Eater failed to scratch either my sci-fi itch or my fantasy itch (sorry for the gross metaphor!)<br /><br />I can handle weak characterisation or unlikeable characters in a sci-fi book because, for one thing they're usually shorter, and secondly they're usually more idea/theme-driven than epic fantasy. In epic fantasy I'm looking for strong characterisation and an interesting/atmospheric world so that I can get immersed and lost in the story. Sun Eater has the scope and length of an epic fantasy but the fact that I didn't like the main character and wasn't vibing with the prose made it harder to feel immersed, and the length ended up being more of a drag making me less willing to engage with the thematic discussions being had.<br /><br />I haven't read much epic sci-fi or science fantasy... in fact I'm struggling to think of any series besides Sun Eater that would qualify. There's Star Wars of course, but that's a whole different medium. (EDIT: Just remembered I've read Dune 🤦) This experience is making me wonder if that combination is something I even like, or is it just bad luck that I chose this series as my first. I have Expanse and Red Rising on my to-read list so I guess I'll find out when I get to them!<br /><br /><b>Conclusion</b><br /><br />If you read the whole of this long-ass review then... thank you. I'm fully aware of the hypocricy of criticising this book for being long-winded in a 2000+ word review! In conclusion, this book wasn't bad and I'm glad for all my friends who read it and loved it, but it sadly wasn't for me. I begrudgingly award 3.5 stars.",3
"Wow! Look out Memories of Ice you have a competition.<br />Howling Dark, the second entry in the Sun Eater series is a fantastic sequel to what already a great debut. If this series continues this upwards trend in quality, I could see this series becoming a favorite of mine. Already this is easily the second-best book I've read this year after Memories of Ice. And contending for the first place though I doubt it'll win. The first book was very good. Finding a way to blend the sheer epic scope with Ruocchio's rather simple story. In this book, the story is far from simple. And the world-building is fantastic. It's actually kind of hard to express why this book is so good. The writing is phenomenal, I think this might be some of my favorite Prose ever. And this book makes me want to read Demon in white as soon as possible. Hadrian is a good character. And his relationships with others are very well developed and defined so much so that the ending here made my eyes well up with tears. Be it with Switch, Jinan, Bassander Lin, Pallino, Kharn Sagara, or Valka. Valka most of all because of his relationship with her is actually one of the most compelling things about this book for me. It's really hard to write good romances, but I really like these two. I mean what else can I say. It's not quite like Memories of Ice where I know what I loved about it. I just know that I loved this and will make sure Ruocchio gets the recognition he deserves by recommending this series to as many people as I can see this series gearing up to be one of the best sci-fi series of this generations. And I will make sure people know it.",5
"<br />Howling dark surpassed Empire of Silence in every way and Empire of Silence was already really good.<br /><br />Plot and Pacing: <br /><br />This was what surprised me the most. The plot in Howling Dark was one of the best plots ive read in Sci Fi/Fantasy, period. I will keep it very vague due to mantaining this review spoiler free so you will have to trust me on this one. Its full of twists and mindfucking stuff.<br /><br />Prose: <br /><br />Ruocchio is in my top 3 prose authors of all time and yall should experience his prose, its amazing. <br /><br />Themes: <br /><br />Theres so much to unpack here: The necessity of heroes; What one needs to become to defeat evil; Immortality; Human modification; Etc... <br />I could keep listing them, theres a lot of themes in this book.<br /><br />Worldbuilding:<br /><br />The scope is huge, epic space opera, homunculi, genetically modified humans, ancient civilizations,<br />alien species, Cyberpunk, you name it its here.<br /><br />Characters:<br /><br />Howling Dark improved every side character we got introduced in Empire of Silence and nuanced our protagonist, Hadrian Marlowe.<br /><br />Fantastic book, cant wait for Demon in White.",5
"Howling Dark was an improvement on the first book in every way possible. I think the character work was better, the sci-fi concepts were even more mind blowing in this one and the plot is way more fast paced which I really appreciated. I thought all of the parts of the book that revolved around the quest to find the 15,000 year old king with a thousand faces, and the mystery revolving around the Quiet was exceptionally crafted in this book.<br /><br />I loved the leadup to the conclusion where you know the book is either going to go one of two ways and the fates of both the human race and alien race may be determined from the events of that day. Even though I loved the ending of this book, I still had some issues with this book mostly with the pacing, with the second half of the book being much stronger in that regard. But I am still so excited to pick up the third book in this series!",5
"97/100<br />first read 2022. reread 2023.<br /><br />banger from start to finish. an improvement on every front from the first book. a super well paced book for being 750 pages, with all kinds of cool shit happening throughout, including some Lovecraftian horror elements that make up some of my favorite scenes in the whole series. the worldbuilding and lore gets even deeper and you start to get some answers to things from the first book--while also having more questions. this Ruocchio guy writes some good books.",5
"<b>""In his extreme youth Stoner had thought of love as an absolute state of being to which, if one were lucky, one might find access; in his maturity he had decided it was the heaven of a false religion, toward which one ought to gaze with an amused disbelief, a gently familiar contempt, and an embarrassed nostalgia. Now in his middle age he began to know that it was neither a state of grace nor an illusion; he saw it as a human act of becoming, a condition that was invented and modified moment by moment and day by day, by the will and the intelligence and the heart.""</b><br><br><blockquote>

</blockquote><br><br>William Stoner grew up on a farm, a hardscrabble farm too small to provide more than just subsistence living. They were an undersized family for that time period, just his father and mother and himself. It took all of them to keep up with the backbreaking work of a farm in the early 20th century. His father, in his own way, a visionary man could see that farming was on the cusp of great changes. He sent Stoner to the University of Missouri to find out what the future was going to be for agriculture. Stoner wasn't an inspired student. He still had to work on a relative's farm to pay for his tuition and found the more work he did the less help he got from his relatives. He still had to go back to the family farm and help his father whenever he had spare time. He was almost too busy to worry too much about school<br><br>The first pivotal moment for Stoner is when he is sitting in an English class taught by his future mentor. The professor puts him on the spot asking him to explain a Shakespeare Sonnet. Stoner was dumbfounded not only with embarrassment, but by the language of the English bard. He switched majors from the department of agriculture to the department of English literature. <br><br>I grew up on a farm about 80 years after Stoner, as anticipated by Stoner's father, production agriculture took great leaps forward replacing a lot of backbreaking labor with machines. Farmers were able to increase their land holdings as tractors and thrashers allowed them to maximize daylight hours. I stacked a lot of hay, feed cattle in subzero weather, pulled calves (you've never been properly slimed until you've spent time up to your elbow in a cow's uterus.), fixed fence, rode tractors listening to Royals baseball games to keep from dozing off, drove trucks full of grain, and every minute I wasn't doing something for the farm or playing sports I was reading books. My parents don't know how it happened. It must have been an aberrant gene. Nobody I knew read books, except for the good book, which most of the time I couldn't tell they'd grasped many of the concepts of that book either. <br><br>The 1980s farm crises hit just as I was coming of age. Land values had jumped up and many farmers had expanded their operations. Then land values plummeted and bankers started realizing that the loans they had made to these farmers were no longer secured with enough equity. They started calling their customer's notes due. Thousands of farmers were forced to sell out. My Dad survived by the skin of his teeth. He decided there was no future in farming and told me I was going to college. My younger brother was a better fit for farming anyway. My Dad knew that I wasn't really cut out to be a farmer (my nose in a book all the time might have been the tip-off). A crises for many created an opportunity for me. Like Stoner I majored in English Literature. <br><br>Stoner becomes a teacher. He decides not to go to war with his friends and suffers from the stigma of swimming against the tide. This is a theme for Stoner, going his own way, ignoring the odd looks, and the snide remarks. He meets a demure young woman named Edith and pursues her doggedly believing that his kindness would be recognized and appreciated by someone so fragile. The description of the consummation of the marriage is one of the grimmest most agonizing that I have ever read. <br><br><i>""Edith was in bed with the covers pulled to her chin, her face turned upward, her eyes closed, a thin frown creasing her forehead. Silently, as if she were asleep, Stoner undressed and got into bed beside her. For several moments he lay with his desire, which had become an impersonal thing, belonging to himself alone. He spoke to Edith, as if to find a haven for what he felt; she did not answer. he put his hand upon her and felt beneath the thin cloth of her nightgown the flesh he had longed for. He moved his hand upon her; she did not stir; her frown deepened. Again he spoke, saying her name to silence; then he moved his body upon her, gentle in his clumsiness. When he touched the softness of her thighs she turned her head sharply away and lifted her arm to cover her eyes. She made no sound.""</i><br><br>For a man so sensual and in need of romantic love he unfortunately married the wrong woman. He hoped for a partner, but found himself roped to a woman that embraced invalidism and waged nasty little wars against him that by his nature made him incapable of defending himself. He finds solace in books and spends more and more of his time at the University in Jesse Hall reading. <br><br><a href=""https://s1183.photobucket.com/albums/x462/jkeeten/?action=view&amp;current=JesseHall.jpg"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">

</a><br><b>Jesse Hall at the University of Missouri</b><br><br>Stoner makes enemies of some of his coworkers. He is so unsuited for office politics that it proves to be a detriment to him. Though I was so proud of him towards the end of the book when he cleverly outflanks a department chair intent on driving him from the profession. <br><br>He meets a woman, a very special woman as if molded by the gods to be the perfect mate for him. Her name is Katherine Driscoll and the gymnastics involved with the misinterpretations, missteps and miscues of their burgeoning relationship left me emotionally drained. There are movies sometimes or television shows where the audience is on the edge of their seat waiting for the moment when the characters finally realize they are meant to be together and kiss for the first time. Well it wasn't a kiss that became that epic moment for William and Katherine. <br><br><i>""He found himself trembling; as awkwardly as a boy he went around the coffee table and sat beside her. Tentatively, clumsily, their hands went out to each other; they clasped each other in an awkward, strained embrace; and for a long time they sat together without moving, as if any movement might let escape from them the strange and terrible thing that they held between them in a single grasp.""</i><br><br>Stoner's enemies leap at an opportunity to destroy him. Even the liberal community of a university has it's limits. Stoner for the first time in his life is becoming the person he always wanted to be, but the heady days of joy are under assault, and he is trapped by his own sense of honor. He suffers for love just as he is starting to understand it.<br><br><i>""In this forty-third year William Stoner learned what others much younger, had learned before him: that the person one loves at first is not the person one loves at last, and that love is not an end but a process through which one person attempts to know another.""</i><br><br>This is such a deceptively simple novel. The sparse, powerful prose give this book so much depth. Stoner gets under your skin. He is so stoic in the face of continued and unremitting harassment from the people around him that I found myself sharing the pain with him. The author John Williams grew up on a small farm in Texas and had a similar escape to the University as Stoner and I. He ended up developing the writing program for the University of Denver. In the introduction by John McGahern he relates something that Mr. Williams said that resonates with me as well. <br><br><i>Williams complains about the changes in the teaching of literature and the attitude to the text ""as if a novel or poem is something to be <b>studied</b> and <b>understood</b> rather than <b>experienced</b>.""</i><br><br><a href=""https://s1183.photobucket.com/albums/x462/jkeeten/?action=view&amp;current=JohnWilliams.jpg"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">

</a><br><b>John Williams</b><br><br>I'm a reader that likes to be told a story. I don't want to break books down to their mathematical or scientific structures. I want the mysticism, the emotion of a journey that expands my understanding of humanity. William Stoner is as real to me as the mailman that delivers my mail or the publisher that signs my checks. If I ever run into him I will shake his large, farm hardened hand and ask him if he has a little bit of time to talk to me about a certain sonnet written by a man by the name of Shakespeare.",5
"I read Stoner after I saw that almost all my friends on GR had read it. It’s an impressive work which I finished months ago but hard a hard time figuring out what to say about it with thousands of reviews already out there. <br><br>Stoner is the life story of an unremarkable man and the consensus seems to be “he did his best.” He came from a Missouri farm family and a poor background but manages to become an English professor at the university. One theme is the ‘loneliness’ and ‘distant courtesy’ of many of the characters, which I think applies to Stoner himself. This may be a trait of many academic folks who have some kind of social disability and turn to books as a substitute for social interaction. <br><br>He’s awkward around women but finally marries. Then we get I think, the most tragic lines in the book: “Within a month he knew that his marriage was a failure; within a year he stopped hoping that it would improve.”<br><br>His wife is constantly exhausted and at the edge of hysteria. After they have a child (a girl) his wife seems so uninterested in the child that Stoner becomes mother and father. His wife deliberately takes away any pleasures he has, such as converting his den to her “art studio” so that he can’t spend time alone with his daughter while he works as she does her homework. Let’s put it this way: his wife is “nucking futs.”<br><br>His life at the university offers limited respite to his hell at home. He gets into what is initially a trivial dispute with his department chair. The chair become his sworn enemy and punishes Stoner by taking away his graduate seminar courses. To a large extent Stoner is “an academic novel” highlighting all the backbiting and pettiness we’ve come to expect in these stories. <br><br>One faculty member says: “It’s for us that the University exists, for the dispossessed of the world; not for the students, not for the selfless pursuit of knowledge, not for any of the reasons that you hear.”<br><br>Stoner lets himself become a little crazy in the classroom. He loses the notes and becomes a good teacher, but this takes him several years “He suspected that he was beginning, ten years late, to discover who he was; and the figure he saw was both more and less than he had once imagined it to be. He felt himself at last beginning to be a teacher…” His younger colleagues recognize him as “a ‘dedicated’ teacher, a term they used half in envy and half in contempt…”<br><br>He has contradictory feelings about his life. On one hand: “He was forty-two years old, and he could see nothing before him that he wished to enjoy and little behind him that he cared to remember.” And yet, and yet…. “Except for Edith’s absence from it, his life was nearly what he wanted it to be.” <br> <br>“He found himself wondering if his life were worth the living; if it had ever been. It was a question, he suspected, that came to all men at one time or another…” “Dispassionately, reasonably, he contemplated the failure that his life must appear to be.” <br><br>He thinks “What did you expect?” and that becomes his mantra as he lies on his death bed. Is he heroic? Or is he a loser? <br><br>It’s easy for an outsider to look back at Stoner’s life and tell him where he went wrong. Just as we can imagine a good friend or a brother or a sister telling us “you should have done this, Jim; you should have done that.” It’s obvious to them where we went wrong; yet they can’t see all the things we think and feel at the time; they can’t live our lives for us and despite all the advice and evidence that we should have done THIS or done THAT, instead we DON’T do that or we DO something entirely different. So as I look at Stoner’s life, here’s where I think he went wrong. Easy for me to say. I’ll put this in a spoiler in the unlikely event that there is anyone still out there who has not yet read Stoner:<br><br><input type=""checkbox"" class=""spoiler__control"" aria-label=""The following text has been marked spoiler.

Sure, in those days fewer people divorced, but some did. He stayed in a terrible marriage for the good of his daughter. But as an adult, his daughter turned into an alcoholic with her husband’s parents basically raising their grandkid. Why didn’t he challenge his wife even on some of the smaller things such as when she took away his den out of spite? It was his and his daughter’s only island of sanity in that house. Why didn’t Stoner stand up for his woman friend when the university forced the breakup of their ‘improper relationship’? They truly loved each other. Why did it take him 20 years to find a solution and fight back against his spiteful chairman who punished him by taking away his graduate courses?</label> <br><br><img src=""https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1516717386i/24900999.jpg"" width=""242"" height=""363"" alt=""description"" class=""gr-hostedUserImg"" loading=""lazy""><br><br> Well, Stoner, “What did you expect?” How did that work out for you? <br><br>photo of the author from thefriendlyshelfiles.wordpress.com<br><br></[""br""]></[""br""]></[""br""]></[""br""]></[""br""]></[""br""]></[""br""]></[""br""]></[""br""]></[""br""]></[""br""]></[""br""]></[""br""]></[""br""]></[""br""]></[""br""]></[""br""]></[""br""]></[""br""]></[""br""]></[""br""]></[""br""]></[""br""]></[""br""]></[""br""]></[""br""]></[""br""]></[""br""]></[""br""]></[""br""]>",5

So at first, I was not impressed. But I soon realized that the novel is impressive precisely because it is able to be so damn linear, the writing style so damn plain, and the characters so damn dull and yet... and yet it manages to make me continue reading on, driven by what I don't know. There is a constant melancholy through the book, but also its points of light.<br><br>So that was the first 100 pages or so. Then it gets good. I mean, really good. But I don't know why. Nothing that much changes, it is just events in the life of this guy. But I start to really care about him, or really understand him... or something. Let me just put it out there: this is a depressing novel. It is a devastating novel. It made me cry. But it is not one where horrible thing after horrible thing happens to good people. Many of the things that happen are... yes, horrible, but also very normal... they are more like small dissappointments.<br><br>John Williams is able to kill you softly with his immovable patience, his prose which is like the most patient thing in the world, and which builds and builds by inching closer and closer to the precipice. Precisely because he is not flashy. Precisely because he is so restrained in his prose, that you never realize it when you're right on the edge of the cliff and you're like ""wait, how did I get here?""<br><br>Also: I don't mean to suggest that his prose is boring. His prose is beautiful. But straight forward. And very functional. It is in service to the subject matter. And the fact that it is not flashy 95% of the time makes it all the more devastating the other 5% of the time, when he floors it as in this passage:<br><br>""Years later it was to occur to him that in that hour and a half on that December evening of their first extended time together, she told him more about herself than she ever told him again. And when it was over, he felt that they were strangers in a way that he had not thought they would be, and he knew that he was in love."" p53<br><br>or in this passage:<br><br>""It was a passion neither of the mind nor of the flesh; rather, it was a force that comprehended them both, as if they were but the matter of love, its specific substance. To a woman or to a poem, it said simply: Look! I am alive."" p 250<br><br>I've rambled long enough. Let me just say a few more things, because I'm a bit delirious. The characters. They are complex and blameless. That is part of the devastation. You can't blame them for the decisions they make. Each one, even the ones that make our protagonist's life hell, you can't blame them because the writer makes you understand (slowly) why they are the way they are. What drives each character to drive each other mad. I read on one of these goodreads reviews someone said ""It only troubles me that every single thing that Stoner thinks and says and does seems so incredibly right, or at least perfectly understandable, on first reading."" That's what I mean. He didn't do anything wrong. Everything he does is understandable. He was just being himself the best way he knew how. And so was every character in this book.",5
"<blockquote>
  <i>What did you expect?</i>
</blockquote><br />I know this book touched me deeply because I am mentally going through every person I know to figure out who I can recommend it to. Most of them, I think. It's <i>that</i> kind of book that-- while still telling its own individual story --contains so many universal themes. Life, death, love, family, failure, integrity. And it's exactly the right amount of sad; bittersweet, I would say.<br /><br />It tells the life story of William Stoner, a man we are told in the very beginning of the book would be remembered by hardly anyone after his death, the marks he made during his lifetime being faint and few. But what this leads into is an extremely well-written story of a man who grew up on a farm, was sent to study agriculture by his father and, there, at the University of Missouri, fell madly in love with literature and teaching.<br /><blockquote>
  <i>Sometimes, immersed in his books, there would come to him the awareness of all that he did not know, of all that he had not read; and the serenity for which he labored was shattered as he realized the little time he had in life to read so much, to learn what he had to know.</i>
</blockquote><br />Stoner did very little to carve himself a place inside my heart. Maybe it was the simple, humble nature of him that asked for so little and gave so much. His passion for teaching was pure and endearing. If anything, I sometimes wanted him to fight for himself a bit more, but it was not in his gentle nature.<br /><blockquote>
  <i>In his forty-third year William Stoner learned what others, much younger, had learned before him: that the person one loves at first is not the person one loves at last, and that love is not an end but a process through which one person attempts to know another.</i>
</blockquote><br />Along the way, he marries, has a child, gets into a conflict with a colleague and loses friends and students to two World Wars. His life is full of ups and downs, sometimes allowing him happiness, often not. Through it all, he finds a certain comfort in his books and his classes. His turning to literature during the hard times spoke to me personally.<br /><br />Summarised like this, it seems like such an unremarkable life and, as the opening paragraphs tell us, it sort of <i>was</i>, but I guess what is so wonderful about this story is that it shows how even a fairly average, unremarkable life is so full of passion and love. Personally, I didn't want to put it down.",5
"<br><img src=""https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1486672316i/21939880.jpg"" class=""gr-hostedUserImg"" loading=""lazy""><br><br>For the hardworking men and women living in the open, windswept farm country of the American Midwest during the late 19th and early 20th century, day-to-day existence was frequently harsh and occasionally downright hostile, a stark, demanding life chiseling character as can be seen above in artist Grant Wood’s <i>American Gothic</i>. If you take a good look at this painting and then envision a son, an only child, working the fields alongside his father, you will have a clear image of the starting point for <i>Stoner</i>, John Williams’ classic novel of quiet perfection.<br><br>The novel follows the life of William Stoner from his boyhood on a Missouri farm through his years as a faculty member of the English Department at the University of Missouri. William Stoner is a good man, a man of integrity, a man, as we eventually find out through his relationship with a fellow faculty member, Katherine Driscoll, capable of profound intimacy and tenderness of heart. William Stoner is also a lover of literature, accomplished scholar and dedicated teacher.<br><br>But all is not well in the life of Professor Stoner, particularly in his home life. As a beginning instructor right out of graduate school, he marries a woman barely twenty years of age from St. Louis, the daughter of a banker, a young woman by the name of Edith Elaine Bostwick. Turns out, young Edith has suffered emotional abuse. And right from the start of her marriage, Edith inflicts emotional abuse on her husband Stoner and eventually on their daughter Grace. Personally, I found reading those parts of the novel involving Edith particularly wrenching bordering on painful.<br><br>Indeed, as readers we live through the pain of Stoner dealing with Edith’s wall of emotional frigidness and coldness, which includes being relegated as a husband in his late twenties to sleeping on the parlor coach at night. Through all the years of isolation and alienation, including Edith’s wedging a wall of separation between Stoner and Grace, there is one particularly poignant scene where we read:<br><br>“Once, while Edith was upstairs, William and his daughter passed each other in the living room. Grace smiled shyly at him, and involuntarily he knelt on the floor and embraced her. He felt her body stiffen, and he saw her face go bewildered and afraid. He raised himself gently away from her, said something inconsequential, and retreated to his study.” <br><br>For a child to become bewildered and afraid when a parent expresses such tenderness and affection speaks volumes to the level of emotional abuse at home.<br><br>Rather than dwelling on the grimness of Stoner’s family life, I will conclude with a final observation: Grace gives birth to a baby boy but after one brief visit did not return to the home of her parents with her son since, as Stoner realizes on his own and Grace tells him in so many words at one point during her whiskey drinking (and, yes, a grim fact: she has turned to alcohol), she got herself pregnant in the first place to escape the prison of her mother’s presence. Well, my goodness – as readers we have a good idea what it would mean for a sensitive man like William Stoner to be deprived of a relationship with his grandson.<br><br>Turning to Stoner’s professional life, there are serious cracks within the halls of academe. He is a man of integrity and honesty and the political infighting within academic departments is famous for being vicious and nasty. I wouldn’t want to say any more so as to spoil for a reader, but I can assure you Dr. Stoner is on the receiving end of a large dose of viciousness. But through it all, our main character remains strong. One memorable paragraph from the novel: <br><br>“But William Stoner knew of the world in a way that few of his younger colleagues could understand. Deep in him, beneath his memory, was the knowledge of hardship and hunger and endurance and pain. Though he seldom thought of his early years on the Booneville farm, there was always near his consciousness the blood knowledge of his inheritance, given him by forefathers whose lives were obscure and hard and stoical and whose common ethic was to present to an oppressive world faces that were expressionless and hard and bleak.”<br><br>Incidentally, when I was a 12-year old boy I joined me father, mother and sister as we took a trip in our car from the New Jersey shore across the American Midwestern heartland of farms to pay a visit to my grandmother. On the trip out and also in my grandmother’s town, I heard a number of harrowing tales of farm life, especially for the children of farmers. I reflected on those tales of physical hardship and unending toil and thus wrote this surreal micro-fiction some years ago:<br><br>DOWN ON THE FARM<br><br>Before he leaves the city they tell him how the country doctor drives a buggy made from the flesh and bones of his former patients.<br><br>“Nothing goes to waste,” is the way they put it when he finally arrives, “we’re all farmers around here.”<br><br>He joins the doctor on his first visit to a farmhouse to attend a sick woman. Instead of a thermometer, the doctor sticks his middle finger under the woman’s tongue and says, “I’ve done this enough times to know when someone has a fever.”<br><br>He looks over the doctor’s shoulder out the farmhouse window. Beyond a skeleton tied to a pole, he sees the farmer plowing his field using his younger son harnessed as a beast of burden.<br><br>“Doesn’t that take superhuman strength?” he asks the doctor.<br><br>The doctor answers, “His older son wasn’t quite as strong, but still makes a fine scarecrow.”<br><br><img src=""https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1486672852i/21939908.jpg"" class=""gr-hostedUserImg"" loading=""lazy""><br>American author John William (1922-1994)",5
"After 63 pages: “Stunned by Stoner. This is agonisingly wonderful.”<br /><br />At the end: “Finished. Him and me. Exquisite but exhausted.”<br />Then I immediately started rereading - something I have only previously done with children’s picture books. <br /><br />It is, without question, my joint favourite book ever. The other, utterly different ones are Titus Groan/Gormenghast (which I reviewed <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/310390629"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">HERE</a>) and the Heaven and Hell trio (which I reviewed <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1681027916"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">HERE</a>). But it’s hard to explain its mesmerising power in a way that does it justice. <br /><br /><b>What Sort of Story? </b><br /><br />It opens with a page of downbeat, but carefully crafted spoilers, rather like an obituary, after which, the story is told straightforwardly and chronologically, from William Stoner’s last days at school and on his parents’ farm, to life as a university student, then university faculty member, marriage, parenthood, affair, and finally his death. His main joy is literature, and the university that enables him to share that love with others, reflected in simple but heartfelt words on his retirement, “Thank you all for letting me teach”. <br /><br />It sounds dull, banal or both, but it's not. It's heartbreakingly beautiful, without being sentimental, and because Stoner is never without hope, I didn't find it a depressing.<br /><br /><b>Contrasts: Eloquence and Inarticulacy, Strong and Weak, Success and Failure, Gain and Loss</b><br /><br />It’s a book about language and literature, and yet inarticulacy is a recurring theme: it is the direct cause of most of the pain, but also the trigger for his main happiness: in a compulsory literature review, it is his inability to understand, or perhaps to explain his understanding of Shakespeare’s Sonnet 73 that triggers a life-long passion and career. This reticence or inability to talk about innermost thoughts is perhaps one reason why the causes of Edith's behaviour are only hinted at: anything more explicit would set the wrong tone (and might not have been appropriate when published).<br /><br />Almost all Stoner’s dreams come true, but happiness is always elusive and ephemeral. The good things are lost or, worse still, taken away by someone he had hoped would be his love or friend (Edith and Lomax, respectively). Both antagonists are sensitive, damaged people (as is Stoner) and Lomax even shares his love of literature for similar reasons (escape). <br /><br />One message of the book is “carpe diem” (seize the day, or in youth speak: YOLO), which is also reflected in Sonnet 73’s focus on decay, death, and enjoying what we have while we can.<br /><br />Stoner can be brave, such as swapping from an agricultural degree course with its predictable future to an English literature degree, inspired by a sonnet he struggled to explain – and yet he doesn’t have the courage to tell his parents until after they’ve attended his graduation.<br /><br /><b>What Sort of Man? </b><br /><br />Some see Stoner as passive and weak. Certainly there are many times when I wanted him to act differently, or just to act at all - in particular, to stand up for his daughter and his lover. <br /><br />Instead, he is quietly stoical, which is apt, given his areas of interest include classical Greek literature. His quiet stoicism, born of parental fortitude and nurtured by habit and habitat runs too deep for him to act as others would.<br /><br />He loses everything he values (even the rapport with his students and the ability to enjoy his books) and in many respects, he is a failure as son, husband, father, lover, even scholar – but he keeps going, never bearing a grudge, trying his best. So sad, and yet curiously inspirational.<br /><br />There are some autobiographical aspects: from a dirt-poor farm to university lecturer, and of personality and (some) demons. See this interview with Nancy Gardner Williams: <a href=""https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2019/02/20/mrs-stoner-speaks-an-interview-with-nancy-gardner-williams/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">HERE</a>.<br /><br /><b>Time and Place</b><br /><br />Unlike some readers, I find Stoner entirely believable, especially when you consider the much higher social cost of divorce back then. <br /><br />Would the story be any happier if it were set today? It would certainly be different, but flawed people raise flawed people. Tolstoy famously wrote “All happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way” and that would be just as true of one unhappy family transplanted from one period in history to another. <br /><br />In a contemporary setting, even if he had married Edith (unlikely?), she would surely have got help (bi-polar abuse survivor?), though maybe too late to fend off divorce. Either way, matters would turn out better for Katherine and Grace, and Lomax and Walker would probably not have got away with as much as they did. I'm sure it's no coincidence that Williams set it more than a generation earlier than the time he was writing.<br /><br /><b>Speaking to Me</b><br /><br />Why did this book move me in such a direct and personal way? I'm not a man, not American, wasn't born at the turn of the 19th/20th centuries and have never been a farmer or a professor. But I do love books, I do need escape sometimes, and I did spend much of my childhood on a family farm, though there was never any expectation that I would be a farmer. <br /><br />The farm is part of it though: in some ways, Stoner reminds me of my beloved grandfather, who died when I was 14. Although he had a happier life than Stoner, he had the same quiet but dogged resilience, and always tried to make the best of what life or wife threw at him.<br /><br />The other aspect that poured from the pages, especially second time round, was the emotional damage caused by bad parenting (albeit sometimes with good intentions), caused or exacerbated by poor communication. I was repeatedly reminded of Larkin’s famous lines “They fuck you up your mum and dad… But they were fucked up in their turn” (see below). Although I had a largely happy childhood, there were odd, complex and problematic aspects that have left their mark on the sort of adult and parent I am, and although I’m the mother of a wonderful 20 year old, I’m very conscious of things my husband and I could, and perhaps should, have done differently. (I think we’re doing better than the Stoners, though.)<br /><br /><b>Other Themes</b><br /><br />Soil. Stoner is a son of the soil and there are many allusions to its power to spread and bind, whether seeping through the floorboards or being ingrained in the skin or mind. Soil chemistry is the only agricultural course mentioned by name, and Stoner enjoyed it – until he discovered his greater love: literature. He is transplanted from the countryside to the university, where he puts down roots, and stays – no matter what. <br /><br />The university is the setting for almost all of the novel and arguably a character in its own right. Early on, one of the characters muses whether it is a path to self-fulfillment, an instrument for social good, or just an asylum. The novel quietly demonstrates that it is all three. <br /><br />“Lust and learning… that’s really all there is” says one character, but both of those need an outlet. The insularity of most of the main characters and their unwillingness or inability to discuss or even show their feelings means they are lonely outsiders who can’t relish life. That aloneness exerts a high price that manifests itself in different ways; the saddest outcome is for Grace, Stoner’s daughter. We need to reach out to each other, communicate, and seize the day. <br /><br />At times, Stoner is like Don Quixote, with Gordon Finch as a brighter and more influential sidekick than Sancho. This friendship is the one enduring human relationship. Finch repeatedly takes risks to help his friend, and yet it is a very understated friendship, that is not especially close. An area to explore further on a reread?<br /><br /><b>Problematic Aspects</b><br /><br />There are three troubling aspects, but that conflict is part of what makes the book compelling:<br /><br />•	Two characters are self-described “cripples”. Times and vocabulary have changed, so that’s not the issue. What is harder is the fact that both characters are unpleasant and both use their disability to make false and malicious claims of prejudice to their own advantage.<br /><br />•	What are the issues around consent for <input type=""checkbox"" class=""spoiler__control"" aria-label=""The following text has been marked spoiler.

Her “enduring violation” while he “performed his love as quickly as he could, hating himself for his haste and regretting his passion” sounds awful for both.</label><br /><br />•	The emotional abuse and manipulation of children is ghastly – but sadly credible. <input type=""checkbox"" class=""spoiler__control"" aria-label=""The following text has been marked spoiler.

She is seen indirectly, in relation to Stoner and their daughter and it's easy to revile her for the slow and calculated cruelty she inflicts. I think Edith is meant to be closed and to some extent unknowable (because of her childhood) and because it puts the reader in Stoner's shoes.<br /><br />I wondered if she was bi-polar. Such a term is never used, and I’m no expert, but her regular alternation between extreme industriousness and prolonged periods of being helpless and bedridden for no outwardly visible reason suggest something like that to me. <br /><br />Another factor is surely her cold and repressive childhood, and <input type=""checkbox"" class=""spoiler__control"" aria-label=""The following text has been marked spoiler.

"<b>Those who can, do. Those who can't, teach.</b><br><br>What to do when everything goes wrong? Work, marriage, parenthood, eventually health? Plenty of benevolent advices and platitudes will whizz around your ears, to help you to bounce back . Remember, it is all in your mind. Happiness is the result of your approach to life, not of what happens to you. Revolt, anger, complaining or denial won’t change anything. Focus on what is instead of on what should be. Accept, accept, accept. Take one step at time, keep moving, keep working to what you want in life.<br><br>In our times of voluntarist belief in shaping our own destiny, only fools refuse or refrain to act or at least to try to take control of their own life .<br><br>But perhaps the only sensible thing to do is keep breathing. Minimal action, minimal reaction. Just embrace plain and simple old-fashioned and untimely Stoicism. Like Stoner. Wisdom lies in tuning our lives to the divine order of the universe and to want what actually is the case. As emotions have an external source, as we are being moved, touched, affected, impassioned, be the Master of Yourself and control your emotions. Do not strive for pleasure. Be un-touched. Only a fool tries to impose his own selfish desires upon reality and is the plaything of his emotions and desires. The consolations of philosophy applied to ordinary life. <br><br>Amongst the teachers I know, there is a bittersweet running joke, when talking about the essence of their profession. Why does someone chooses to become a teacher? And, bursting with self-mockery laughter, they sing in unison <i>Those who can, do. Those who can’t, teach</i>. Stoner’s friend Dave Masters, could probably agree with it, when he is partly ironically speaking about the true nature of universities: <i>”It is an asylum or — what do they call them now? — a rest home, for the infirm, the aged, the discontent, and the otherwise incompetent.""</i><br><br>This novel strongly reminisced academic life, its seclusion and petty machinations. Not having Stoner’s gift of endurance, I fled, abandoning the dream of a life of learning and science after 6 years of struggle, as university was not the refuge and source of wisdom this naive working class daughter hoped for, but a ruthless, almost egotistic habitat crushing me – a place where teaching didn’t really matter. As <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1060982573?book_show_action=false&amp;from_review_page=1"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Ian</a> trenchantly points out, if we empathize with Stoner’s dire life, couldn’t it be because of our own wounds and experiences too? <br><br>Imagine yourself living together with Stoner. However wise and admirable his stoicism, there is also a solipsistic aspect to it. According to his creator, Stoner is altogether a happy man:<i>”He had a very good life. He had a better life than most people do, certainly. He was doing what he wanted to do, he had some feeling for what he was doing, he had some sense of the importance of the job he was doing.”</i> But what about the effect of his stoic attitudes on the lives of the others in his life? His parents, wife, daughter, lover? Does he really care? I disliked Williams’s portrayal of Edith, Stoner’s vicious battle-axe of a wife – I guess I am not conversant enough with the perception of American women in that part of history, but her one-dimensional depiction hardly exceeds the caricature image of the neurotic frigid female, like the Madge in Frank Zappa’s <i>Harry you’re a beast</i> (You paint your head - Your mind is dead -- You don't even know what I just said - THAT'S YOU: AMERICAN WOMANHOOD! You're phony on top - You're phony underneath - You lay in bed &amp; grit your teeth. MADGE, I WANT YOUR BODY! HARRY, GET BACK! MADGE, IT'S NOT MERELY PHYSICAL! HARRY, YOU'RE A BEAST!).<br><br>Coming no further than these personal musings, I feel not able to do justice to this poignant novel, hitting a little too close to home, for more than one reason. Yes, Stoner is as unforgettable a character as many reviews point out. Yes, in many respects, I have known a Stoner. We were married for 16 years. He was, like Stoner, the most stoic person I ever met. He illustrated his philosophy lectures with a cartoon from D. Palmer’s <a href=""https://goodreads.com/book/show/1425095.Looking_at_Philosophy_The_Unbearable_Heaviness_of_Philosophy_Made_Lighter"" title=""Looking at Philosophy The Unbearable Heaviness of Philosophy Made Lighter by Donald D. Palmer"" rel=""noopener"">Looking at Philosophy: The Unbearable Heaviness of Philosophy Made Lighter</a> ; afterwards showing it to our children to teach them equanimity when things didn't work out as they would like they did. As I am not that stoic like he was, because of its ending, I didn't have the heart to pass the book to him. <br><br><a href=""http://postimg.org/image/gk46z5249/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">

  <u>THIS WAS MY BEST BOOK OF 2016!</u>
</b><br><br>It was a hard decision; it was a choice between this and <i> The Vegetarian</i> by Hang Kang. But I had to think which book taught be the most, and which book helped me the most. I enjoyed them both immensely, I loved them, but this one set me on my path in life; thus, I will always be grateful for John Williams and his <i>Stoner. </i><br><br>******************************************************<br><i>
  <b>He opened the book; and as he did so it became not his own. He let his fingers rifle through the pages and felt a tingling, as if those pages were alive. The tingling came through his fingers and coursed through his flesh and bone; he was minutely aware of it, and he waited till it contained him, until the old excitement that was like horror fixed him where he lay……</b>
</i><br><br>William Stoner has a terrible life: his marriage is a disaster; his daughter resembles her damaged mother; his teaching career is hindered by an argument with a fellow faculty member, and he is subjected to continual waves of misery. All in all, it’s a sad life: it’s his life. However, through all the shit times, and the occasional glimpses of happiness, one thing keeps him animated; it’s a thing every reader knows: a love of words, a love of books and a love of the wonderment of literature. I will never forget the journey I shared with Stoner in these pages. <br><br>He is a flawed man. When he was a student he had no real ambition or drive. He didn’t know what he wanted to do, but he knew what he didn’t want to do: he didn’t want to be a farmer like his farther. A university lecture inspired him with the marvels of Shakespeare; he asked him a question, a question that changed Stoner’s life. The result was a switch in academic discipline and an enthusiastic perusal of everything literature based. Stoner became engrossed with his work; he quickly forgot about the outside world, and refused to take part in the war effort. This is a feeling I know all too well. When one is completely engrossed in reading, obsessed even, it becomes difficult to pay attention to reality. If you’ve made it this far into my review, then I probably don’t need to tell you that. Stoner had what he needed: he had his books. But, life isn’t always that simple. <br><br><i> “He had come to that moment in his age when there occurred to him, with increasing intensity, a question of such overwhelming simplicity that he had no means to face it. He found himself wondering if his life were worth the living; if it had ever been.” </i><br><br>A profound question to ask oneself, and I truly think this helped to consolidate his decisions. Student life comes to an end for most folk. For Stoner there is no end. University is his home; it is his life; it is his passion and his drive: it is the one and only constant in his existence. So why would he ever leave it? Why would he ever give it up? The student becomes the teacher, and Stoner extends his stay for a lifetime. He has nothing else to cling to, only a love for his field of scholarship. I cannot quite express how much I sympathise with this character here. As a student of literature, and a huge hobby reader, sometimes there seems to be little else on the horizon but to peruse one’s passion. For Stoner though, his choice was the only one he could ever have made. His existence is only really for one purpose, and because of this he realised very early on his consequential fate. <br><br><i> “It’s like it just all goes around and around and keeps on going. It makes you wonder.” </i><br><br>As Stoner gets older his peers begin to die. In this he sees what awaits him; he has the stark realisation that he, too, will die. This may seem trivial and an obvious fact of life, though a realisation of such magnitude can really alter character. Stoner has a midlife crises; he has a glimpse of what his life could have been like had he married his soul mate: his love and intellectual equal. It is a shame for Stoner that such a thing came when he was already settled, but, again, that’s just life. This problematic relationship sets him even further on his course. I don’t need to tell you about the ending. It is an obvious conclusion for such a book, though I will say that its delivery was nothing short of perfection. Never before have I read a book in which the entire thing is embodied in its final few words. I’m amazed. I’m shaken. I’m stunned. I’m numb. <br><br><b>&gt;Why you should read this:</b> I don’t often go as far as to explicitly state something like this in a review. Reading is personal and subjective. My reviews are just my opinion; they may not be shared by others. With this, however, I would go as far to say that this <u>
  <b>should</b>
</u> be read by every reader, every reader who has felt the sharp pangs that literature can evoke. Here is a man who is completely lost; here is a character that has nothing really to live for: here is a man who is lost in the words, and it’s his salvation. And this is his life story. This is not a simple novel. It is a bildungsroman that is tragic, emotive and even inspiring. This book opened my eyes to many things. I learnt a great deal about life and myself in the process. Trust me, fellow bibliophiles, go read it. This is something really special. <br><br> <img src=""https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1456827754i/18280198._SX540_.png"" width=""400"" height=""300"" alt=""description"" class=""gr-hostedUserImg"" loading=""lazy""><br><br>__________________________________<br><br>You can connect with me on social media via <a href=""https://linktr.ee/sean.ultra_vegan1"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">My Linktree</a>.<br>__________________________________",5
"<i>""… a quiet sadness for the common plight was never far beneath any moment of his living.""</i><br /><br />This novel damn near broke my heart. Come to think of it, it did break my heart. I’ve been picking up the pieces and trying to put them back together for the past eleven days since finishing it. I don’t know what else to say that hasn’t already been said about this exceptional piece of writing. We are William Stoner. Isn’t there a piece of him in every single one of us? We go about our lives with the best intentions. Looking for friendship. Searching for love. Thinking we’ve found it and then not exactly knowing what to do with it. Making mistakes and yet enduring. Sometimes doing battle but mostly resolving ourselves to our individual circumstances. <br /><br /><i>""The past gathered out of the darkness where it stayed, and the dead raised themselves to live before him; and the past and the dead flowed into the present among the alive, so that he had for an intense instant a vision of denseness into which he was compacted and from which he could not escape, and had no wish to escape.""</i><br /><br />This is another one of those contemplative novels that leaves me feeling like I’m in the presence of a wise soul. He or she speaks to me quietly but with an underlying urgency I cannot ignore. This soul is not showy but quite pure and simple. It’s achingly honest. I have to wonder though – do we all necessarily damage one another? Do the effects of a hard life trickle down through the generations so endlessly? I hope not. Love, marriage, and parenting – such challenging waters to navigate at times. Our best is never good enough. Perhaps we are the harshest judges of our own actions.<br /><br /><i>""Dispassionately, reasonably, he contemplated the failure that his life must appear to be.""</i><br /><br />It can’t get more depressing than that. Yet, there were glimmers of hopefulness and happiness that guided me through to the end of this book. Moments in time that make it all worthwhile. Love for literature and finding love itself. Loving a child. Do we really need an abundance of everything? There were some passages that really took hold of me and wouldn’t let go. I’m still in the clutches of Stoner’s (and John Williams’) words. <br /><br /><i>""Sometimes, immersed in his books, there would come to him the awareness of all that he did not know, of all that he had not read; and the serenity for which he labored was shattered as he realized the little time he had in life to read so much, to learn what he had to know.""</i><br /><br />I’ve always been able to relate to that. Sitting surrounded by our massive piles of books, we can all empathize, I’m sure.<br /><br /><i>""… the person one loves at first is not the person one loves at last, and that love is not an end but a process through which one person attempts to know another.""</i><br /><br />It kind of makes you want to fall in love all over again, doesn’t it?!<br /><br />I don’t know why I waited so long to read this novel. I knew I would love it. This was the first book I picked up on the first day of the new year, new decade. I wouldn’t be surprised if it remains my favorite of the year.",5
"I asked my daughter if me and her and her mother were in a hot air balloon and it was about to crash into the ocean who would you throw out to keep the balloon aloft, me or your mother? She said she’d throw me out. I said Why? She said Because you’re bigger than her. So I said okay, imagine that me and your mother weigh exactly the same, then who would you throw out? She said she’d throw me out. I said why? She said because you’re older, so you’ve had your fun. So I said okay, imagine that me and your mother weigh the same and we’re exactly the same age, now who would you throw out? She said she’d throw me out. I asked why? She said because you keep asking all these stupid questions. So I gave up on that line of enquiry and read <i>Stoner</i>, a much loved novel.<br><br>It’s about this teacher. Boy, do people like to wax sentimental about teachers. There’s Mr Chips in <i>Goodbye Mr Chips</i> and there’s John Keating in <i>Dead Poets Society</i> and that’s just off the top of my head. William Stoner in this sorry tale is a Missouri farm boy who goes to university to study agriculture then gets smacked upside his head by one of Shakespeare’s sonnets and never looks back. He becomes a worshipper at the shrine of literature, with a capital L and becomes a teacher of it.<br><br>This is the kind of study of Literature where a student will announce<br><br><i>I intend to trace Shelley’s first rejection of Godwinian necessitarianism for a more or less Platonic ideal through the mature use of that ideal as a comprehensive synthesis of his earlier atheism, radicalism, Christianity and scientific necessitarianism</i><br><br>You at the back wake up! I’m not even half way done with this damned review. Well, university English departments did and maybe still do crank out students who write this sort of abstruse shite and it’s all just as useful as the great theological treatises about the nature of the Logos in St John’s left earhole or whether it was 5000 herrings or 5000 cod in the feeding of the 5000. What a colossal waste of time. <br><br><b>HE FELT AT TIMES THAT HE WAS A KIND OF VEGETABLE</b><br>(p. 184)<br><br>Yes, I could not but agree, possibly a leek or a radish or a turnip or a mangel wurzel. Stoner is exactly what a vegetable would be if a vegetable could be a junior professor in English at the University of Missouri. He plods dully through his life in a very vegetably way. He sees a pretty girl at the age of around 25, having apparently never seen one before, and thinks “I…will…marry…that” and does so. This turns out to be a giant MISTAKE.<br><br>Like Smokey Robinson said in 1961<br><br><i>Gotta get yourself a bargain son<br>Don't be sold on the very first one<br>Pretty girls come a dime a dozen<br>Try to find one who's gonna give ya true lovin'<br>Before you take a girl and say I do now<br>Make sure she's in love with you now<br>My mama told me<br>You better shop around</i><br><br>In all fairness, William’s mother never gave him this advice as she was still down on the farm rassling with the piglets. Edith, the bride, turns out to be the very dictionary definition of damaged goods. Some readers think she’s simply bonkers but John Williams puts in a scene which clearly shows where her fear and hatred of men has come from, and it was all very sadly believable. <br>So poor old Bill. He’s married a cross between Joan Crawford in <i>Mommie Dearest</i> and Glen Close in <i>Fatal Attraction</i>. No bunnies are harmed during this novel, it is true, but there is a strong suggestion that Edith would have boiled up a dozen if only she’d have thought of it. <br>Oh and then Bill Stoner gets embroiled in a ridiculous trench war in the English department, the upshot of which is that now his boss also hates him and spends 25 years making sure his professional life is a misery. <br><br>What a pickle! Hated by wife and boss! Onward plods the vegetable, through the rest of his painful life. <br><br><img src=""https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1495045575i/22779779._SX540_.jpg"" class=""gr-hostedUserImg"" loading=""lazy""><br><br>For the first half I had to agree with the vast majority of 4 &amp; 5 starrers of Stoner. It was weirdly compelling. It was boring but kinda hypnotic, like Donna Tartt’s <i>Secret History</i>. It was boring in an interesting way. But jeez, then it all becomes a little too much. If it’s a plot spoiler I will say that for 30 pages or so our Bill is actually HAPPY! But you know and I know that won’t last and we’ll be back to stoically enduring and gritting teeth and shoulder to the wheel. So the stars began to fade away and by the last page <i>Stoner</i> was very lucky to hang on to his third star.<br>",3
"I was going to start out this review of <i>Stoner</i> by feigning comic incredulity that the former conductor of the Boston Pops wrote a novel about potheads, but that is far, far too obvious and unsatisfying even for the likes of me. Instead, I am going to confess that I read only half of it (and, thereby, my ignorance has been properly disclaimed) but that this aborted reading filled me with such unmitigated contempt for the author that I plan on mounting every soapbox (if soapboxes haven't been technologically obviated by now) from here to the Great Barrier Reef condemning this plodding, tiresome, amateurish book with an antagonistic passion that literature hasn't evoked in me since Cambridge's <i>A Concise History of France</i> (wherein concision meant excising significant historical events in favor of agricultural data and a dimly Marxist perspective, but I digress -- as always).<br /><br />I shouldn't blame John Williams for my rising blood pressure because in fact YOU are to blame. Yes, you. Perhaps not individually, but in the general sense of Goodreads voters and reviewers, of which you are presumably a constituent. As of this moment, <i>Stoner</i> has an average rating of 4.39 stars out of five on the basis of 531 Goodreader ratings. This is a remarkable score, to be sure, but as with many averages, it is complete and utter bullshit -- obviously contaminated by the spurious opinions of the ardent fans of graceless, tedious prose. You know who you are.<br /><br />Let's parse the data, shall we? 459 people gave this turd four or five stars; whilst only eleven people were courageous enough to call a spade a spade and, against the grain of general opinion, to award it only one or two stars. I consider these eleven people <i>heroes</i>. You and your ilk can eulogize the armed forces, the pigs, the schlubby, mustachioed rescue workers, with your tearful montages of wars, standoffs, and celebrity house fires, all assembled to the reactionary tunes of 3 Doors Down or Nickelback; I prefer a subtler form of heroism -- you know, the lone voice who amid the Russophilic, ostentatiously intellectual acclaim for Bulgakov's <i>The Master and Margarita</i> dares to raise an eyebrow at this dry Goethe wannabe...<br /><br />I therefore am a great hero because, fighting the insidious cabal of 'respectable' opinion, I offer my head to the rabble in order to warn you what a lifeless stinkbomb <i>Stoner</i> is. John Williams, I suspect, was an author who was better suited to actuarial work or fumigating. Something more prosaic. His main problem is that he wants desperately to tell you everything. He's adamant that you know this or that about his main character William Stoner's psychological make-up, habits, and proclivities, but unfortunately he'd rather put Mr. Stoner behind a glass wall at the zoo and recite a bunch of vague adjectives and banal activities relevant to him. In placing Stoner in the zoo and preparing a dry summation about him, he deprives Stoner of life, abbreviates him into a concept...<br /><br />This is one of the worst kind of all writers, in my opinion. He's committed to telling us and not to showing us. He wants to control your attitude toward the characters by completely demystifying them. Williams lays everything on the table, as if he's handing you a psychological abstract. More than a few times, I wished that John Williams were not dead and were ready-at-hand, so I could give him a chocolate swirlie. And then I pulled back in my condemnation for a moment... I rethought my rage... There are literally jillions of shitty writers on this planet, and a not-insignificant number have had their works published. Why should I blame John Williams for having a dream -- a grand ambition? I wish for nothing less myself. The intended repository for my rage and general ill-will should be those who have applauded this crapfest -- the ones who've elevated it to the status of minor classic of 20th century American literature. <br /><br />The straw which broke the <i>etc.</i> came midway through the book when Stoner's wife, until then a mousy, retiring, sickly sort, adopts a new attitude after the death of her father. She bobs her hair (it's the 1920s) and throws out her old clothes and buys some of those shapeless flapper-type shifts, and -- more consequentially -- she declares war on her husband. The psychology might as well be written in neon. She resents the dull (and not very affluent) academic life her husband provides. The switch is so abrupt and ridiculous that all of the author's explanations and expositions do nothing to make it palatable, even in his stubbornly distanced and abstract telling. I've read better character development when we got in small groups to discuss our first stories in Creative Writing 101.",1
This is quite possibly the saddest novel I've ever read. It's certainly one of the most beautiful.,5
"I have very conflicting emotions regarding this novel so I decided not to rate it. For almost half of the novel I thought all the 5* reviews were right and I was listening to a literary masterpiece. Then, something happened and I started to get pissed of by the author and Stoner. I still very much enjoyed the subtle beautiful prose but I could not ignore some aspects that bothered me. I will explain in more detail what I mean but there will be spoilers. Because of that, I will start with a short spoiler free review and then get into more detail. Before everything, I state that I understand how most people read this novel and why they appreciate it and also what the intention of the author was. What follows is how I ""felt"" while reading, a mix of appreciating for the novel but also some indignation. Indignation might be good in some books but I am not sure this was the author's intention. <br /><br />SPOILER FREE REVIEW.<br />William Stoner, the son of a farmer, is sent to University to study agriculture. There, he falls in love with the world of the written words and changes his major to literature. He abandons his family and their hope to improve their farm to follows his passion. Don’t worry, this is not a book about passion, it is more about the lack of it and about stoicism. He is told by his mentor that he should be professor so he decides to follow that path because he had no better plans anyway. He later marries the first girl he likes, a decision he will come to regret soon enough. The novel becomes a long succession of small bouts of restrained happiness and longer periods of extreme misery. Everyone seems to be against him and try to hurt hm. It is one of the finest examples of misery lit and stoicism again the hurts life throws at you. It was endearing and heart breaking for a while until it became too much. The stoicism became inaction/victimisation and a disappointment to me. The writing is beautiful, although detached it felt hypnotic and I had the compulsion to listen on and on. Although we are told about a series of events in the life of William Stoner I was not bored most of the time. <br /><br />SOME SPOILERS FROM NOW ON<br />Alright, what went wrong? The magic started to dissipate after Edith came back from her father’s funeral reincarnated as Cruella, with revenge on her mind. I did not like the sudden transformation of Edith into a super villain who made every effort to make poor William’s life a living hell. She was a damaged woman from the beginning but this extra evilness/craziness felt artificial, like the author had someone in his past that he needed to take his revenge on. Stoner was the only victim, not once did the author consider Edith’s feelings and psychology. The marriage was arranged between his father and Stoner, she didn’t really have a say in the matter of her life. Her planned Holiday to Europe was cancelled and she became the wife of a stranger. It is suggested she also had some past trauma so that did not help either. Nevertheless, she was presented only as a perpetrator.<br /><br />Secondly, the whole affair with the other two supper villains, the physically impaired duo, was also hard to stomach for me. I did not clearly understand the reasons behind their vendetta and their hate for the “hero”. What bothered me the most was his inaction to save his daughter, which is something I cannot forgive. I could have been lenient and take it as part of the story but the author considers Stoner a real hero, an example of resistance against the world who wants to harm him. He is the only victim, his wife and daughter are negligible. The writer does not see them as victims as well. So, yes a blame the author because I did not give this book 5 stars. The way the books started, I thought there was no way to give it less.",0
"William Stoner was born in 1891 in a poor peasant family. In the hope that he would return to the farm better armed to confront a thankless Earth, his parents sent him to Columbia University in Missouri to follow a course in agriculture. But quickly, the young Stoner discovered a considerable interest in literature and abandoned agriculture to enroll in a Bachelor of arts. «His clumsy fingers turned the pages with the most care, terrified that they were to the idea of damaging or tearing what they had worked so hard to discover.» Stoner is far from a genius, but he gets his doctorate and becomes a professor at Columbia University. <br />During the first world war, Stoner decides not to engage. ""We shouldn't ask professors to destroy what they have, their life, sought to build."" This decision is the first of a long list that is no less harmful as he will carry it through life with embarrassment. So occurs Edith Bostwick, the girl of the right family, and Stoner ignites and is considering more experience without it. The marriage concluded quickly, but it turned sour on the first night. Stoner's marital life will mark by resentment and hostility, and these bitter feelings trouble the couple's only child. <br />Stoner has passion and knowledge. He teaches, hoping to be a smuggler, but quarrels with another teacher hinder his career. So, once again, he resigned and continued a contemplative and stubborn, University life as if the work was his only hope of salvation. ""During the Christmas holiday, [...], William Stoner made aware of two things: on the one hand, the importance and the crucial place of his daughter in his existence, on the other hand, the idea that it was possible, that it was possible to become a good teacher."" <br />Failed husband, bruised father, and frustrated teacher, Stoner is a dynamic character who seems programmed to make bad choices and beat a retreat when one would expect him to fight. ""What he moved it, he spoiled him."" He is not a coward or a loser, but he is without scale, and he always feels an 'absence to himself, as if events took place without him and marked history. ""He was forty-two years old—nothing before motivated him again and so little behind which he loved to remember. "" Stoner said the strength of the weak, this patience without hope that let us wait for better days. <br />What tenderness I had for this man, long and curved, needy and inhabited by a desperate passion for books! ""He had never lost from view the chasm that separated his love of literature of what he was able to testify."" This novel is not colorful; it occasionally happens, not much, but it develops a quiet reflection on the lives of those who need books. With filigree of the history of the United States - prohibition, the stock market crash of 1929, rural poverty, modernisation-the Stoner lifestyle is not a tragic piece but a parable. Friends of books, this novel is for you!",5
"John Williams's <i>Stoner</i> blew me away. I've never read anything like it and some passages left me moved to the point of exhaustion. When I finished I put down the book (well, the Nook), picked it up again, and re-read highlighted pages. <i>Stoner</i> gave me strength; if you believe that the right books find you at the right time, as sometimes I believe, this book found me at the right time.<br /><br /><i>Stoner</i> outlines the life of a farm kid who, at his dad's recommendation, attends college for agricultural studies but switches to literature and becomes a low-level university faculty member for most of his career. He marries an affluent city girl, starts teaching, and loves his daughter. His marriage begins to crumble and he starts an affair with a student. He runs afoul of university politics and lands an insulting teaching schedule. Williams manages, with breathtaking grace, to create complex, nuanced characters through lean, careful sentences. He'll pass years with a few heartbreaking paragraphs and allow the reader to generate what's between the lines. <i>Stoner</i> is like a Rothko painting put to words; empty blotches, perhaps, at first glance, but sublime, minimalist depth with time and attention. Characters <i>change</i>, but not all the way, then change back again, and, if a happy ending emerges, it's a still, sublime happiness. <br /><br />I'm a teacher so I was, of course, overlaying my own background on the text while reading. But I think I would have appreciated <i>Stoner</i> anyway. The novel's power rises from its quiet, subtle movement. An excellent introduction (I don't think I've ever said that before...most introductions are stupid) in the NYRB edition includes a rate Williams interview in which the author describes the main character as heroic for, essentially, sticking to his own values and doing the best he can. What might appear as small failures are potentially victories in the context of Stoner's values (which, in other characters' eyes, sometimes appear as stubbornness). And even if you can't control every element of your environment, the politics at your job, how the people you love respond to challenges, and other variables across the multitudes of contexts, you can respond with grace and dignity. And when, nearing death, he experiences this:<br /><br /><i>A sense of his own identity came upon him with a sudden force, and he felt the power of it. He was himself, and he knew what he had been</i><br /><br />I wanted to raise my fists in the air and recognize all of the invisible punk rock people living quietly, without affectation, holding as true as possible to their cores in the face of unrelenting messages that there is something wrong with them and they should feel other than they do and be other than what they are. <br /><br /><i>Stoner</i> is amazing. You might not like it, I suppose, as some of my GR friends didn't. But even glancing through the text, searching out quotes, makes me feel more alive. For me, <i>Stoner</i> is one of those books. Thank you, Mr. Williams. You made my weekend. And beyond.<br /><br />P.S. In some of the book's NYRB promotional materials Tom Hanks praises <i>Stoner</i>. I swear, Mr. Hanks, if you turn this novel into a movie, I will beat your ass. At least on the internet. I'm afraid you'll include scenes in which you're standing on a leaf-blown quad, deep in thought, staring into the sky, while treacly strings play in the background and the camera pans high and away. Don't fucking ruin this novel, Mr. Hanks. I'm warning you.",5
"i have started and stopped writing this review several times because i cant seem to find words big enough to do this book justice or words strong enough to hold how i feel about it. <br /><br />this is a story about an average man living an every day life. it could be considered unglamorous, boring, and even frequently disappointing. but isnt life often unglamorous and boring and disappointing? and i think thats the genius of this novel. to take a common man and make you love him because you realise that you and him arent unalike, that you too feel common. <br /><br />but when you have the opportunity to see an entire life in front of you, such as william stoners, you realise that the beauty is in the little things. that the simple life, the quiet life, is significant. that the individual life is worth examining. <br /><br />and it gives you hope and comfort to know that if the life of an average man is of value, then yours is too. <br /><br />and there are no words to describe that. <br /><br /><b>↠ <i>4.5 stars</i></b>",5
"Career opportunities...<br /><blockquote>He saw the future in the institution to which he had committed himself and which he so imperfectly understood; he conceived himself changing in that future, but he saw the future itself as the instrument of change rather than its object.</blockquote><br />William Stoner is a humble soldier of science, the one belonging to the majority of scholars. He is an outsider of life, honest and conscientious.<br /><blockquote>…he had gone through a kind of conversion, an epiphany of knowing something through words that could not be put in words…</blockquote><br />When I think of William Stoner I imagine a scriptorium in a monastery and a monk copying the old musty vellums. The scriptor is long dead and gone but his manuscripts persist.",5
"I've read such an excessive amount of books, you might imagine I stumble upon treasures like Stoner every day. Ha! That's hilarious. <br /><br />I read every day, and I discover through that process many good books and many average books, but rarely do I find a life-altering gem such as this.<br /><br />Stoner is one of those quiet, slow-paced novels that stabs you right in the heart with its painful, accurate knowledge about life and how most people live it. Yes, it's sad but true; the average person will have a less than stellar childhood, a complicated partnership and end up with a career or a job rather than a youthful dream fulfilled.<br /><br />Yes, too many people live rather unremarkable lives, and far too many of them suffer, too.<br /><br />Yet. . . sometimes the snow falls quietly over your little corner of the world, and you feel completely blanketed by its peace. . . and, sometimes a tree in autumn spontaneously drops its leaves just upon you and you look up at the sky in unparalleled wonder. . . and, sometimes a small child reaches out to touch your arm in trust and comfort and you realize the awe of your responsibility, that someone so precious and pure loves you, exactly as you are.<br /><br />And, that is how this book is. You can't rush it. You need to embrace the moments where you gasp a bit or your eyes fill up with tears, or you feel filled with a hot rage over the injustices that fill this everyman's life.<br /><br />If you loved Edith Wharton's <i>Ethan Frome</i> or Kent Haruf's <i>Eventide,</i> or Graham Greene's <i>The End of the Affair,</i> then you probably have the heart and the literary taste for this type of slow-moving, deeply-penetrating novel.",5
"<b>“William Stoner entered the University of Missouri as a freshman in the year 1910, at the age of nineteen. Eight years later, during the height of World War I, he received his Doctor of Philosophy degree and accepted an instructorship at the same University, where he taught until his death in 1956. He did not rise above the rank of assistant professor, and few students remembered him with any sharpness after they had taken his courses. When he died his colleagues made a memorial contribution of a medieval manuscript to the University library. This manuscript may still be found in the Rare Books Collection, bearing the inscription: ‘Presented to the Library of the University of Missouri, in memory of William Stoner, Department of English. By his colleagues.’ An occasional student who comes upon the name may wonder idly who William Stoner was, but he seldom pursues his curiosity beyond a casual question…”</b><br />-	John Williams, <i>Stoner</i> <br /><br />Even if I had completely hated John Williams’s <i>Stoner</i> – and there were times while reading it that I thought I did – it would have been worth my time to pick it up. If nothing else, it is <i>interesting</i>, both in its content and its backstory.<br /> <br />Originally published in 1965, this tale of a decidedly average literature professor at the University of Missouri came and went without causing much of a ripple. In 1994, Williams died. Then, in 2006, the <i>New York Review of Books</i> reissued the novel, and it caught fire. Suddenly, critics were calling it “the greatest novel you’ve never heard of.” It became a surprise bestseller in Europe. It helped make the case for John Williams as one of America’s great authors.<br /> <br />For me, that was reason enough to give this a look, especially since its length (about 300 pages) does not require a huge investment of time.<br /> <br />Beyond its peculiar second life, though, I was intrigued by <i>Stoner</i>’s substance. According to an interview given by Williams, this is an “escape into reality,” a portrait of a man’s life shorn of the usual dramatic flourishes found in fiction. The eponymous central figure, William Stoner, is not a brave soldier, brilliant lawyer, or dashing doctor; he does not go on great adventures; he is not part of a love triangle; he does not stand up for the little guy, battle evil, or change the world. He is not, in other words, the typical shoulders upon which you would rest a novel. <br /> <br />From the start, Williams almost dares you to keep reading. His introduction to Stoner, excerpted above, is not only unsentimental, it aggressively downplays the protagonist’s very existence. Williams is essentially telling his audience in the very first pages that Stoner is not worth reading about. This is sort of an anti-hook, a bit of reverse psychology that – in its own way – is as effective as “It was the best of times, it was the worst of times” or “Call me Ishmael.” <br /><br />Like Stoner himself, <i>Stoner</i> is unpretentious and unfussy. There are no narrative tricks, twists, or turns. The plot is simply Stoner’s life, followed in chronological order in unadorned prose, from his entrance into college until his death. Nothing extraordinary happens. The First World War rages, but Stoner does not enlist or get drafted, taking a curiously uncurious approach to a worldwide cataclysm. The Great Depression falls upon the country, but Stoner has tenure. He gets married to a woman who is a low-key terror (the inexplicable behavior of Stoner’s wife is one of the novel’s major weaknesses), finds himself entangled in the low-stakes, high-intensity politics of the English department (where he simply accepts all the bad hands he is dealt), and writes a book (which unsurprisingly amounts to a ho-hum product). There are moments of happiness, many more of sadness; there are some minor successes, but mostly modest failures. <br /><br />As I mentioned above, the true fascination I had with this book is Williams’s handling of Stoner. The protagonist of a novel does not need to be a hero, or even a good guy. Typically, though, the main character is an agent of movement, driving things forward by taking action or making decisions. <br /><br />Stoner is not like this. <br /><br />Stoner is not even <i>reactive</i>. Instead, he is as passive as a rug. Things happen to him, and he just keeps going, head down. His governing principle for long stretches is indifference, which to me is one of life’s cardinal sins. There are times I wanted to throttle him. I wanted to shout at him. His marriage is a ruin, yet he takes no effort to fix it. His child desperately needs him as a parent, yet he sits on his hands. He makes an enemy at the college, and simply absorbs the abuse. He has a chance to grasp happiness, yet lets it walk right out the door. Stoner is fond of William Shakespeare’s sonnets, but just once I wanted him to read Dylan Thomas, to muster up the effort to rage – just a little – against the dying of the light. It never really happens. <br /><br />Stoner’s stoicism is part of the reason <i>Stoner</i> has had such a vibrant reemergence on the literary scene. For the most part, I found it incredibly frustrating, as I have mentioned at length. At the same time, one of the ways I know a book is working for me is when a character gets me angry. I wouldn’t have found myself literally talking aloud to Stoner if I didn’t care about him. This is a real bit of wizardry on Williams’s part. Essentially, I found myself loving this mainly because of the audaciousness of the conceit that Stoner is worthy of a novel. <br /><br />As I reached <i>Stoner</i>’s unexpectedly powerful conclusion, however, I found my reaction deepening. I thought of the oft-quoted lines from Lucius Annaeus Seneca, in his Moral Letters to Lucilius: “Sometimes even to live is an act of courage.” Having seen it so often, I have seldom paused to consider the line’s meaning. <i>Stoner</i> really forced me to ponder its implications. <br /><br />The most frightening aspect of life is death, and this is an aspect that everyone must – at one time or another – meet head-on. To move forward in the face of this terrifying unknown is an underappreciated facet of humanity. By the end of Stoner’s journey, I began more and more to respect his quiet dignity, his tenaciously-held values, and his calm fearlessness at the precipice of eternity. For all Stoner’s many faults, Williams utterly convinced me – by the final page – that this man’s life was worthy of a tale.",5
"Reread July 2023;<br /><br />It hit harder the third time. I read the last 30 pages this morning and my eyes were unable to stay dry. So painful to read and yet so beautiful to immerse myself in. <br /><br /><br />Reread January 2023;<br /><br />I would never have thought that a story detailing a professor's life could have such a huge impact on me. <br /><br />This experience was better than my first read through, but honestly, my heart is in pieces. I'm so glad my Mum recommended this to me! Phenomenal writing, beautiful, real and sometimes brutal scenes of one man's life and you're left with one woman in tears over here in the UK. Thank you, John Williams for producing one of my favourite works of literacy, and probably one of the best reads of my life to date. <br /><br />July 2019:<br /><br /><br />My heart is deliciously heavy tonight, here in the UK, and it feels damn good! Stoner, is the type of book that I would put to the bottom of my to-read list, purely because I thought the cover and the blurb were dull. Stoner, is the type of book I'd look at, then tell it I'd get to it in a few years or so. Stoner, is a book my Mum recommended to me two years ago, and now I'm sitting here, my eyes still moist with tears, and I'm asking myself the question ""Why didn't I pick this up earlier?""<br /><br />This book has took the very breath from my body, and if one knows me well enough, you'll realise that is a pretty extensive task to take on. I feel revived, and I believe that this book was just waiting, waiting for the right moment to come into my life.<br /><br />We follow Stoner, our main character, as he makes his way through life, quietly, but with assertiveness, making decisions that shape his life, for better, or for worse. From any way in which I looked at Stoner, he didn't meet the expectations of which he should have, but it was his interesting but difficult life, that kept me immersed in this, until the very last page.<br /><br />I believe that as the story progresses, Stoner progresses in his ability to be the person he'd always wanted to be, and that, as a writer, is a masterful thing to achieve. <br /><br />It distresses me actually, that this book for the most part, is going unnoticed, and isn't doing as well as a book with a happy ending and the promise of a hero, for instance. Stoner is a real life account, of a rather ordinary individual, but God, it broke my heart.",5

</pre><br>Albrecht Dürer: Job and his Wife<br><br>Vintage books seem to specialise in producing beautiful paperback editions of titles that have been out of print or have only recently been translated into English. I have a small collection of their red-spined covers sitting on my shelves. They all have something in common apart from the red spines; they are books I may read again sometime in my life because of the quality of the writing, the depth of the characterisation and the overall worth of the contents. They are books that won’t date and that I won’t outgrow. <br><br>A friend placed this Vintage book in my hands last week and said, you must read it and tell me what you think. I was curious as I’d noticed that <a href=""https://goodreads.com/book/show/166997.Stoner"" title=""Stoner by John Williams"" rel=""noopener"">Stoner</a>, although written decades ago, had been getting a lot of attention recently and I was glad of the opportunity to read it at last. I put everything else aside and read the book over a short space of time, unusual for me as I often dip in and out of several books at the same time.<br>My edition has an introduction by John McGahern. McGahern is a writer I respect a lot. I’d love to see his books getting more attention—a re-release of McGahern's works would allow a new generation of readers to see how he evolved over time, how he kept rubbing away at a small number of themes until they were as smooth and perfect as a stone polished by the sea.<br>Smooth but not flat.<br>The word flat occurs to me because I found Williams' writing flat from the beginning, not flat as in spare or plain but flat as in lifeless. <br><br>The early part is a familiar story, the boy from the farm goes to college and meets a teacher who helps him discover his life’s passion. At that point, I thought: oh, wonderful, the author has been using a flat style in the early part so that he can provide a contrast in the section where his hero, William Stoner, discovers the pleasures of literature. And yes, there is huge promise in the device the author uses of having his hero awaken via a Shakespeare sonnet. But, although Stoner goes on to read widely, eventually teaching in a college, his literary journey doesn’t influence the language of the novel very much—there is no interplay between Williams’ writing and Stoner’s literary evolution. It is as if Williams set out to avoid literary resonances, in fact I found more biblical parallels than literary ones. <br><br>But to continue with the literature issues, there are a few examples of Stoner’s teaching skills inserted into the text, and though he does sound like a very dedicated teacher, the extracts from lectures and the questions he puts to a student relating to poetry didn't match with what we are told of Stoner's passion for literature. But I did find it interesting and clever that each time he gazed through a window, or better still, opened a window, the language soared and I was breathing in fresh air alongside the main character. What joy! The few times that happened, I silently willed John Williams to keep the window open. But, except for some moving writing near the end, he preferred not to. <br><br>John McGahern quotes Williams in the introduction: when asked if literature is written to be entertaining, he answers, “Absolutely. My God, to read without joy is stupid”. I wouldn’t put it quite like that but there is truth in what Williams says. And a large part of the pleasure of reading comes from the quality of an author's writing. It’s interesting to note that I’ve struggled to write this review. I’ve been asking myself why it is so difficult to write about <a href=""https://goodreads.com/book/show/166997.Stoner"" title=""Stoner by John Williams"" rel=""noopener"">Stoner</a> and the answer may lie in Williams’ own words: when reading is a joy, the response to it is effortless, the review tumbles out, inspired by the words we’ve read. When there’s no joy, making a response is an enormous effort. However, since I rarely have to make such an effort (as I usually find reading a joy), I’ll challenge myself a little more.<br><br>I’ve concentrated on the writing because it’s always more important for me than the plot but I do pay attention to how the plot and the characters are handled. Early in the novel, Williams decides to have Stoner choose a wife. So Stoner goes to a shop and sees one he likes and decides to buy her straight away. <br>No. I’m joking, of course. And can I point out here that there is absolutely no humour in this book so my joke is out of place. Except it isn’t, because that’s more or less the way Stoner picks his wife. He sees Edith once and decides to marry her. She has no say whatever and Williams even stresses her passive reluctance. So the business is conducted between the girl's father and the prospective son-in-law. But Williams doesn’t plan on presenting this catalogue bride as a victim. Oh, no, the hero is the only victim in every episode of the long saga which is his life (I used the word 'hero' because Williams said in the interview quoted in the introduction that Stoner “is a real hero”).<br><br>I mentioned biblical echoes earlier. Stoner is like a Job figure; every possible plague is thrown at him, and his enemies are horribly diabolical, but he endures all of his ‘undeserved trials’ with the utmost patience and rarely fights back. <br>That would be fine if he alone were the victim. But he is not the only victim. Apart from his wife, whose character remains one-dimensional throughout and her extraordinary ‘evil’ nature unexplained, there is a daughter who becomes the true victim in the story. The author fails to underline that his hero never makes a real effort to save his daughter. I’m not blaming him for allowing the daughter to be sacrificed but I am asking the author to be aware of his main character’s failure to save her. It is never acknowledged. So how can he be a hero? <br><br>Stoner also stands by when a young women he becomes involved with is sacked because of him. Although other reasons are given, the author implies that Stoner can't save her because he has to save his daughter instead. Except that he doesn't save his daughter.<br><br>There were a few occasions when I wondered if Williams was really aware of what he was doing in this novel: the way he has Stoner choose his wife; the way he handles the daughter story; the loose ends that are scattered throughout, and finally, the enemies he chooses for his 'hero' (apart from the ‘evil’ wife). <br>The main enemy is a work colleague called Lomax. There are no reasons given for Lomax’s unrelenting attacks upon Stoner. Both Lomax and the student he engages to help in the vicious attacks on Stoner, have physical disabilities, so one of the implications of their unexplained vendetta has to be jealousy of Stoner’s physical strength. I found that disturbing. John McGahern, in the introduction, refrains from commenting on this aspect of the novel, simply stating that the portrait of Hollis Lomax is “the most complex” in the entire book. McGahern doesn’t really discuss the story in any depth. Instead, he writes an introduction that is little more than a summary as if Williams were an old friend for whom he was doing a favour.<br><br>I mentioned loose ends or red herrings so I had better deal with them before I finish. Stoner refuses to join the army in 1917 when the United States declares war on Germany. His friends join up and one of them, Finch, accuses Stoner of letting everyone down. While we, the readers, might agree with Stoner’s decision, we worry that it will come back to haunt him especially as Finch returns in glory and becomes the dean of the faculty where Stoner teaches. But that threat is never realised, and surprisingly so, considering all the other much more unlikely plagues that fall on Stoner’s head. <br><br>There is some mystery implied about Stoner’s wife and her relationship with her parents but that too is never explained, a big gap since everything about her needs further development. McGahern says she is in the tradition of the ‘beautiful, unstable’ heroine found in O’Neill, Tenessee Williams, Faulkner and Scott Fitzgerald. I can’t imagine that any of those writers created a character as paper-thin as Edith Stoner. <br>A further loose end is Stoner's first literature teacher, a man called Archer Sloane. He is given a significant role in the beginning but is not exploited very much afterwards. That is a real pity as he was my favourite character.<br><br>The front cover of my copy contains a sticker which reads: <br><pre>

"Devastating novel of academia, unfulfilled hope, and a life not-entirely-lived. Gorgeous writing, heartbreaking plot, and if you're a fan, as I tend to be, of stories set in the dark halls of libraries and universities, this is one to read. The love story within this book is suddenly out-of-nowhere rapturous, and the marriage is brittle, delicate, insensible and perfectly done. The book feels so modern, though the bulk of the action is set in the 30's and 40's. I kept stopping to check that this was true - the love affair, in particular, feels like something that might be happening this moment in an office at, say, Middlebury. Stoner's marriage, in contrast, is painfully frozen in time and in the cultural expectations of women in the early part of the last century, but even so, Stoner's wife's personality feels very real to me, and the way it is written about feels revolutionary. Speaking of revolutionary: I don't know why this book doesn't stand with, say, <a href=""https://goodreads.com/book/show/48328.Revolutionary_Road"" title=""Revolutionary Road by Richard Yates"" rel=""noopener"">Revolutionary Road</a>, as a massive classic. By the end, I was holding a hand over my mouth, because I kept moaning in sympathy for poor Stoner. I never felt that way reading Yates - whose characters, though foiled totally by their self-involvement, seem somehow to deserve what they get. Reading this felt more like reading someone like Andre Dubus - full of people making destructive choices, but nevertheless, you feel for them, and feel their humanity the whole time you're reading.

"<i>ARC provided by the publisher—Gollancz—in exchange for an honest review.</i><br /><br /><b>Joe Abercrombie is a genius storyteller. <i>The Wisdom of Crowds</i> is one of the best books of the year, a masterfully crafted conclusion to <i>The Age of Madness</i> trilogy.</b><br /><br /><b>
  <i>
    <blockquote>“What is the point of gathering knowledge if one does not pass it on? What is the point of growing old if one does not try to shape the future?” </blockquote>
  </i>
</b><br /><br />For years I’ve mentioned the <i>Last Argument of Kings</i> as Joe Abercrombie’s best book; it is a masterwork in grimdark fantasy, in my opinion. For years I’ve said Abercrombie probably won’t be able to come up with a novel that matched—or topped—the <i>Last Argument of Kings</i>. Today, that unbending situation changed; I’m gratified to say that Abercrombie has done it. <i>The Wisdom of Crowds</i>, the last book in <i>The Age of Madness</i> trilogy, is up there with the <i>Last Argument of Kings</i> as the best book in <i>The First Law World</i> and his career. And I dare say it’s indeed his most well-written book so far. Last week, I did an interview with Joe Abercrombie on my YouTube channel, and it is one of my most treasured experiences as a book reviewer. I hope to have the chance to do that again in the future because <i>The Wisdom of Crowds</i> is one of the best books I’ve read, and I have some burning questions regarding the revelations unveiled in this novel. Anyway, that’s for the future, now let’s begin with the review.<br /><br /> <b>
  <i>
    <blockquote>“Sometimes, the only way to improve something is to destroy it, so it can be rebuilt better… Sometimes, to change the world, we must first burn it down.” </blockquote>
  </i>
</b><br /><br />Chaos, fury, and destruction; this is how <i>The Wisdom of Crowds</i> starts, and it’s also how the narrative progresses. The Great Change is here, and our beloved main characters—voluntarily or not—are all caught in its sweeping madness. Abercrombie didn’t waste time shifting the story and characters into their crimson path. Right from their respective first chapter, everyone’s plunged into this uncontrollable vicious frenzy. If you’ve read <i>A Little Hatred</i> and <i>The Trouble with Peace</i>, then you’ll know what the chapter “Little People” signifies. Unlike the previous books, the first out of two “Little People” in <i>The Wisdom of Crowds</i> happened in chapter 3; it is that soon. <br /><br /><b>
  <i>
    <blockquote>“How could one man keep his oath when everyone else was breaking theirs, after all? An army very much relied on unity of purpose.” </blockquote>
  </i>
</b><br /><br />From the beginning to the end, not a single page in this novel ever felt dull to me. I know that every author writes differently, but I do wish more authors write and structure their series the way Abercrombie or Michael Sullivan did with their trilogy. For those of you who don’t know, Abercrombie finished writing the entire <i>The First Law</i> trilogy first before he focused on polishing one book at a time. This method was reimplemented for <i>The Age of Madness</i> trilogy, and same with the <i>Last Argument of Kings</i>, this kind of storytelling planning and structure allow Abercrombie to fill the pages of his concluding volume with an incredibly engaging—and believable—revelations and narrative. <i>The Wisdom of Crowds</i> proved that <i>The Age of Madness</i> trilogy has some of his most meticulous plotting so far; revelations are done in abundance, and they never felt out of place. This is a novel—or trilogy—that successfully captured a myriad of relatable themes and character’s actions such as freedom, betrayals, loyalties, conspiracies, leadership, responsibilities, survival, politics, war, ambitions, and the price of progress.<br /><br /><b>
  <i>
    <blockquote>“Have you been outside lately? Wisdom is not at a premium, madness is the fashion, the balance sheets are all torn up and the friends that were assets have become liabilities… Threats for tomorrow don’t cut very deep when today is so damn threatening.”</blockquote>
  </i>
</b><br /><br />I won’t lie; as a long-time and diehard fan of <i>The First Law World</i>, there’s always a part of me that feels gleeful when characters or backgrounds attained from reading the previous six novels plus one collection of short stories appeared. This isn’t to say that I didn’t love or care about the new main characters of this trilogy; if that were the case, I doubt I’ll be giving each book in this trilogy a 5 stars rating. However, prior to reading <i>The Wisdom of Crowds</i>, I never felt like the new main characters could compete with Abercrombie’s previous main characters. Again, I was gladly proven wrong. I’m being truthful when I say there are no characters in <i>The First Law World</i> that I love more than Logen Ninefingers or Sand dan Glokta; they’re too iconic and unforgettable for me. But I’ll be lying if I say that I didn’t immensely enjoy reading the journey of Rikke, Orso, Leo, Savine, Broad, Vick, and Clover. They’re not Logen Ninefingers, and they’re not Sand dan Glokta; they’re never meant to be, and that’s completely okay. By this concluding installment, I personally think these new main characters—especially Rikke, Orso, Leo, and Savine—have earned their spot as some of the most well-written characters in fantasy. I mean, Rikke and Savine have both became some of my favorite characters, too. Say one thing for Abercrombie, say that his level of characterizations is unmatched in grimdark fantasy.<br /><br /><b>
  <i>
    <blockquote>“The past has never interested me. For better or worse it is done, and set, and littered with disappointments as a battlefield is littered with the dead. But the future is a ploughed field, full of potential. The future we can twist into wonderful shapes.” </blockquote>
  </i>
</b><br /><br />I never thought I would end up caring for all the characters in this trilogy this much, but now that I finished it, I felt like there’s a gap inside of me that won’t be filled until Abercrombie write more characters for me to feel invested in. The main characters underwent tremendous character development in <i>The Wisdom of Crowds</i>. The lawless chaos and savage circumstances they’re in have pushed all of them towards becoming a better or cruel version of the person they were. Almost all the main characters realistically changed from their first appearance in <i>A Little Hatred</i>. Wishes buy nothing, and good luck is always in limited supply. Alliances constantly shifted, betrayals and tough decisions have to be unflinchingly executed in order to survive. I loved reading the character’s developments and the conclusion to their story; some made me surprisingly happy and satisfied, and some depressed me. This is an entry in <i>The First Law World</i>, after all, and you have to be realistic about these things.<br /><br /><b>
  <i>
    <blockquote>“It’s a comfort, telling yourself there’s some big right thing out there. That you could seek some wise old bastard in the mountains who’s got the answer. Then there’d be no need for doubts and regrets… But far as I can tell it ain’t that simple. Right things, wrong things, well… it’s all a matter of where you stand. Every choice is good for some, bad for others. And once you’re chief, you can’t just do what’s good for you, or those you love. You have to find what’s best for most. Worst for fewest.” </blockquote>
  </i>
</b><br /><br />The action sequences in <i>The Wisdom of Crowds</i>, once again—I know I sound like a broken record here—established Abercrombie as one of the two best close-quarter combat scenes writers; the other author being John Gwynne. As I mentioned at the beginning of this review, <i>The Wisdom of Crowds</i> started with an explosive bang, but it felt relatively small compared to the third and final act of the novel. The end of the second act was pulse-pounding, and it seamlessly transitioned into the non-stop barrage of mayhem and devastations—emotionally and physically—of the final act. It was all so relentlessly brilliant and insane; the immersion I got from reading Abercrombie’s compelling dialogues and battle scenes are vivid and rare to find in other books. Having read so many fantasy books now, it’s getting harder for me to feel like I’m inside a battle scene with the characters experiencing the glory, terrors, and brutal bloodbath. And reading <i>The Wisdom of Crowds</i> has all these immersion effects on me.<br /><br /><b>
  <i>
    <blockquote>“The sad truth is, men love to follow a man other man fear… Makes them feel fearsome, too. We tell the odd fond story of the good men. The straight edges. Your Rudd Threetrees, your Dogmen. But it’s the butchers men love to sing of. The burners and the blood-spillers. Your Cracknut Whirruns and your Black Dows. Your Bloody-Nines. Men don’t dream of doing the right thing, but of ripping what they want from the world with their strength and their will.”</blockquote>
  </i>
</b><br /><br /><i>The Wisdom of Crowds</i> is, at the moment, the peak of quality in Abercrombie’s prose. It’s unbelievable, but it’s true; Abercrombie has written more than ten novels now, and he somehow keeps getting better and better with each book he wrote. It’s so astounding to me. “Better to do it than live with the fear of it” that’s penned in <i>The Blade Itself</i> remains as one of the important mottos I use to motivate me in my daily life. And in this novel, I highlighted 36 passages. No kidding; there were so many well-crafted sentences and passages I wish I could share with you all, but I’ll leave those for you to find out for yourself.<br /><br /><b>
  <i>
    <blockquote>“History is not the story of battles between right and wrong, but between one man’s right and another’s. Evil is not the opposite of good. It is what we call another man’s notion of good when it differs from ours.”</blockquote>
  </i>
</b><br /><br />Lastly, before I end this review, I’ve mentioned and praise the hell out of Abercrombie’s trademark skill in writing magnificent characterizations, dialogues, battle scenes, and all the grim and dark content. But there’s one more trademark of Abercrombie’s prose to mention: humor. <i>The Wisdom of Crowds</i> is the darkest novel in the trilogy, but this doesn’t mean it’s deficient in its humor. I can’t believe how many times I laughed out loud reading this book; I’m pretty sure most of them were during scenes I shouldn’t laugh about, too. Seriously, there was a chapter involving Clover and Downside that made me laugh out loud. And believe me when I say that I rarely laugh when I’m reading a novel. But that’s the thing; the superb characterizations and humor are what separated and elevated Abercrombie from other grimdark fantasy authors. Amidst the character’s bloody ambitions, ruthless violence, and horrific tragedy, Abercrombie’s cunning capability to insert dark humor at the right—or inappropriate—moment and time made the pacing in his books so captivating.<br /><br /><b>
  <i>
    <blockquote>“Don’t matter how savage a face you show the world, few men dare look the Great Leveller in the eye once he comes calling.”</blockquote>
  </i>
</b><br /><br />Following a comparable contrasting fashion Abercrombie employed in <i>The First Law</i> trilogy, Abercrombie started and concluded <i>The Age of Madness</i> similarly. The first chapter in <i>The Blade Itself</i> is called “The End,” and the last chapter in the <i>Last Argument of Kings</i> is called “The Beginning.” The first chapter in <i>A Little Hatred</i> is titled “Blessings and Curses”, while the last chapter of <i>The Wisdom of Crowds</i> is titled “Curses and Blessings.” And when it comes to reading Abercrombie’s books, this title couldn’t be more apt. It’s a blessing to have read every book in <i>The First Law World</i>, and it’s also a curse to have read them all. <br /><br />Same with the <i>Last Argument of Kings</i> written by the same connoisseur, <i>The Wisdom of Crowds</i> has joined the same esteemed rank of fantasy masterpieces. This is the end of <i>The Age of Madness</i> trilogy, but I doubt this will mark the end of <i>The First Law World</i>. The ending showed glimpses of super exciting things to come in the future of this world. But if this somehow ended up being the end, I truly don’t mind. I’m an extremely happy and satisfied reader to have read all the available nine novels and one collection of short stories in <i>The First Law World</i>. The entirety of <i>The First Law World</i>—<i>The First Law</i> trilogy, the standalone trilogy, and <i>The Age of Madness</i> trilogy—is the greatest grimdark fantasy series that I’ve read. Bravo, Joe Abercrombie; the bar for grimdark fantasy has been raised again. And you, Lord Grimdark, remain absolute as one of the greatest fantasy authors of all time.<br /><br /><b>

But far as I can tell it ain’t that simple.""</i><br /><br />At the end of another Joe Abercrombie First Law trilogy I found myself in a state of euphoria, denial, and struck by a wave of nostalgia. As a loyal advocate for all things The First Law since 2008, this felt different than going through the end of Last Argument of Kings for the first time. Because this felt like it could truly be the end.<br /><br />With the set up leading to The Wisdom of Crowds, Abercrombie has successfully passed the torch to “the kids” in the sequel trilogy. No more longing for the legacy characters, as I had gotten fully invested in the struggles of Orso’s kingship, the doubts of Leo’s rebellion, and the desires of Rikke to fulfill her father’s dream of a united North. I’m all aboard without wondering when Sand dan Glokta is going to show up or if Logen is related to Gunnar Broad.<br /><br />However, what you think you know, just forget it. Abercrombie burns it all to the ground in the first 50 pages and gives us somewhat of a reset from where we were at the end of The Trouble with Peace…and that’s a good thing. This may be the best representation of what things are like at ground level when the whole world descends into chaos. The panic, the desperation, and the destruction at that level is captured brilliantly and Abercrombie’s talents as a writer have somehow gotten even better describing these situations.<br /><br />The Wisdom of Crowds asks those questions like what you would do in their stead if given the keys to the kingdom. Change is difficult and sometimes needed, but when do you know if you jumped the gun on just how bad things actually were?<br /><br />Each of our POV characters take a journey in this one that makes them feel like completely different versions of themselves than they were in A Little Hatred. All of them have grown, for better or worse, into their own identity. You will find yourself laughing, crying, and sharing in the best and worst of times with all of them. Say one thing for Joe Abercrombie; say that he still has the best character work in the game.<br /><br />If this truly is the end, First Law goes out on top of the genre. You get answers to the prophecies and the character theories (I was right on two out of the three really big ones…wait for the spoiler talk) as well as the usual amount of action, betrayals, and politics we have come to expect from a First Law book. As well as some openings left in the ending to question if our characters are doomed to repeat history.<br /><br />If this is truly the end, thank you, Joe. It has been one hell of a ride.",0

I loved the original series, but this book cements for me not only that this trilogy is the greater of the two, but that this book is the best book in the entire <i>First Law</i> universe. I didn't think it could conceivably be possible that this book could be better than <i>The Last Argument of Kings</i>, but somehow Joe Abercrombie has achieved the impossible.<br /><br />This book is filled with chaos, political machinations, absolutely incredible characters, wonderful battles, and the genius writing quality that Joe Abercrombie is now famous for. The twists were equal parts incredible and unexpected, and the ending was literal perfection.<br /><br />I don't want to go into details about this book, because I think you need to read it for yourself without knowing anything about it.

"The Age of Madness series has kept me more emotionally invested than any First Law story since reading the original trilogy. It does so in a way that feels fresh and modern while still maintaining everything that made its predecessors so special – from its strange but lovable characters to the insane mental power struggles inside their heads. <br /><br />While every book in this fantasy world is good in its own way, this one proves to be one of the best thanks to consistent writing for both main and side characters, a compelling political story with good pacing, mysterious magical abilities that surface evermore slightly, and perhaps most importantly, character dialogue that offer more depth and complexity with big and most small decisions that actually impact the story in meaningful ways throughout the course of all 3 books. Most of its fresh ideas go a long way toward elevating the First Law formula into the modern era. Joe Abercrombie has also done a great job of expanding this universe toward both grander and more intimate threats without losing the humor of the original.<br /><br />Most importantly. The Wisdom of Crowds is a not so gentle sendoff to the rag-tag group of characters we’ve known for years and the ones we have only known for a limited time.

"<b>“One must keep a close eye on the current definitions. To be unpatriotic would be terrible. To be patriotic in the wrong way could be fatal.”</b><br /><br />So, I have finished The Wisdom of Crowds. I have now read every book by Abercrombie, including his Shattered Sea trilogy. it was a bitter-sweet experience. He is for sure in my top five favourite authors of all time now, if not top three. So of course, there is an element of sadness getting completely up to date with everything that he has released.<br /><br />The Wisdom of Crowds offers a crazy finale to the Age of Madness trilogy, and the greater First Law books, with twists and turns, subverted tropes, shocking moments and more of what we have come to expect from the brilliant Abercrombie. But, The Wisdom of Crowds was not one of my favourites of his. There are brilliant moments, with chapters and scenes of absolute genius, but as a whole it didn't feel as complete or satisfying as the conclusion to his previous trilogy, The Last Argument of Kings, did. However, The Last Argument of Kings is in my opinion one of the best books of all time, so it is harsh to compare to that.<br /><br /><b>“But here’s the sorry truth – if you really don’t want a thing, you don’t have to keep telling yourself so.”</b> <br /><br />I cannot really go into depth about characters or premise, as that would of course reveal spoilers as this is a third and final instalment of a series. But, I can say that there were brilliant interactions between the PoV’s, and the relationship and inspiration from The French Revolution became far more prevalent as this series reached its final stages. So, there was of course mayhem and an overall feel of anarchy. This provided an element that made everyone feel unsafe, and that is something I love to feel in a book. That extra layer of realism provides so much.<br /><br />Abercrombie brilliantly utilises his prose to enhance the tone and atmosphere, as well as craft character. That is the same here. He makes subtle alterations to his style depending on the character we are following, so that he strikes that perfect balance between nuance and making the character feel unique, but then not too much so that it feels jarring.<br /><br /><b>“She never saw more damage done than by folk acting on high principle.”</b> <br /><br />What held this back compared to many of Abercrombie’s previous books in my opinion was some of the twists. I love how Abercrombie subverts our expectations and resolves plot lines in completely unexpected ways. But, a few times here it was so different that it did not feel very satisfying. A lot was built up, especially in regards to a certain wizard…. And that expectation was never resolved, sadly.<br /><br />But, saying that, it was still a really thoroughly enjoyable read. A 'bad' Abercrombie book is still a really great book. Still a series I would recommend to everyone. It was not disappointing in the sense that it wasn't good. It just wasn't as amazing as I was expecting.<br /><br /><b>4/5 STARS</b>",4

"Terzo e conclusivo romanzo della trilogia dell'Età della Follia di Abercrombie, cronologicamente posta al termine (per ora) del suo lungo ciclo della Prima Legge o del Cerchio del Mondo, come preferite. Se i primi due romanzi mi avevano convinto appieno, questo ultimo chiude in maniera perfetta la trilogia.<br /><br /><i> ""Sono dei mostri"".<br />""Vorrei quasi che lo fossero, sarebbe più facile. Ma sono solo persone"".</i><br /><br />Partiamo con il ricordare, a chi non conosce questo ciclo, che Abercrombie scrive un grimdark puro, dove sono praticamente assenti sia la magia sia creature fantastiche. Qui ci sono solo popoli umani che si combattono per la terra in cui vivono, per le risorse e per il potere economico, nessuna differenza con un romanzo ""storico"" o comunque basato sul crudo realismo. Il focus della narrazione si sofferma sulle vicende di alcuni individui e ne segue la loro storia.<br /><br /><i> ""E Fuoco Sia""</i><br /><br />Dopo i fatti accaduti nei precedenti romanzi, la storia riprende con un notevole calo di ritmo in cui i protagonisti cercano di trovare un posto nel caos dilagante per sopravvivere al Grande Cambiamento in corso. Si tratta di una parte lenta ma necessaria agli sviluppi delle diverse linee narrative dei personaggi coinvolti.<br />Abercrombie scrive in modo appassionato e di conseguenza mi è impossibile staccarmi dalla lettura. I suoi personaggi sono sempre fautori della storia narrata ed hanno un percorso di cambiamento e crescita che in pochi altri romanzi ho riscontrato. <br />Joe si conferma un maestro nel caratterizzare i suoi personaggi. Probabilmente si tratta di una delle migliori trilogie che abbia letto.<br /><br /><i>""Le generazioni future potrebbero non credere che sia successo. E allora potrebbe accadere di nuovo""<br /><br />""L'eloquenza del campo di battaglia"".</i><br /><br />I sogni e le promesse a volte divengono incubi inattesi. Le speranze rimangono vane. Dopo la calma apparente giunge la tempesta. Il cambiamento è solo un'illusione.<br /><br />Ritengo che quando si giunge all'ultima pagina di un romanzo con le lacrime agli occhi e il cuore ormai ridotto a brandelli, aggiungere altre parole sia del tutto superfluo.<br />Trilogia Semplicemente Imperdibile.<br /><br />Grazie Joe.<br /><br />--------------------------------------<br />Third and final novel of Abercrombie's Age of Madness trilogy, chronologically placed at the end (for now) of his long cycle of the First Law or the Circle of the World, as you prefer. If the first two novels had fully convinced me, this last one closes the trilogy perfectly.<br /><br />""They're monsters.""<br />""I almost wish they were, it would be easier. But they're just people.""<br /><br />Let's start by reminding those unfamiliar with this cycle that Abercrombie writes a pure grimdark, where both magic and fantastic creatures are practically absent. Here there are only human populations fighting each other for the land they live on, for resources and for economic power, no difference with a ""historical"" novel or in any case based on crude realism. The focus of the narrative dwells on the events of some individuals and follows their story.<br /><br />""And Fire Be""<br /><br />After the events that occurred in the previous novels, the story picks up again with a notable drop in pace in which the protagonists try to find a place in the rampant chaos to survive the ongoing Great Change. It is a slow but necessary part for the development of the different narrative lines of the characters involved.<br />Abercrombie writes passionately and as a result it is impossible for me to stop reading. His characters are always supporters of the story told and have a path of change and growth that I have encountered in few other novels.<br />Joe proves to be a master at characterizing his characters. It's probably one of the best trilogies he's ever read.<br /><br />""Future generations may not believe it happened. Then it could happen again""<br /><br />""The Eloquence of the Battlefield"".<br /><br />Dreams and promises sometimes become unexpected nightmares. Hopes remain in vain. After the apparent calm comes the storm. Change is just an illusion.<br /><br />I think that when you reach the last page of a novel with tears in your eyes and your heart in tatters, adding more words is completely superfluous.<br />Simply Unmissable Trilogy.<br /><br />Thanks Joe.",5
"Please note this review will contain spoilers for A Little Hatred and The Trouble with Peace, but it is spoiler free for The Wisdom of Crowds. <br /><br />‘Wisdom is not a premium, madness is the fashion, the balance sheets are all torn up and the friends that were assets have become liabilities.’ Vic kept walking, ‘Threats for tomorrow don’t cut very deep when today is so damn threatening.’<br /><br />The Wisdom of Crowds by Joe Abercrombie is the last book in the Age of Madness trilogy, and for now at least, marks the end of our time within the world of the First Law. Before I began this book I was apprehensive about what kind of ending these beloved characters would meet, but I needn’t have been, say one thing for Abercrombie, say he knows how to create a showstopping finale!<br /><br />On the cover of my ARC the words Chaos, Fury and Destruction dominate, and these are apt words, civil war ravages through the lands and the Great Change is fully upon the citizens within the Union, for better or worse. Much like during The French Revolution, the time of Social Revolution has finally come and the oppressors have become the oppressed. The Breakers and Burners have seized power and the nobility must cower before them. Anyone with wealth and prosperity are brought under a knife’s edge and either must be seen as less than they are or face a long fall from grace. The Age of Madness certainly reflects all that this book stands for. <br /><br />Yet there are those who find opportunities even amongst the ruin. Leo Dan Brock, beloved by many, seeks to be the hero for the new age, and Savine must turn her talents for business into talents of survival, she must truly become ‘the darling of the slums’ in every way. Orso finds that being a king has landed him with the worst possible fate, and in the North, Rikke faces a battle all of her own as Black Calder plots his revenge. The time of judgement is upon all. As our characters face an uncertain future, they must also reflect, even learn from the deeds of the past, the once legends now long buried beneath the mud. The past now comes to heads with the future.<br /><br />In my review for The Trouble with Peace I had said that the narrative had leaned more towards the political intrigue side, and even though that was entertaining in its own right, I did miss the action. This time around I felt the balance hit the exact right spot for me. The proud forcefully became humbled, and the poor and lowly suddenly found themselves powerful, yet they were also capable of the same cruelty that was bestowed upon them by the nobility. The ‘new leaders’ also held little knowledge of what to do with their newfound power or even how to run the country. The ‘Great Change’ was not all it was cracked up to be; put simply, everyone was fucked. Abercrombie became the weaver of politics and chaotic battles, each scene expertly builds upon the tension and is doused in his trademark of dark humour, repetitions and a cynical view of the world. The world has literally gone to shit, and the aftermath is nothing but sheer entertaining.<br /><br />‘The Great Change’ was not only symbolic of the world but of its people too, especially some of our main protagonists. The dynamics between the characters is once again fantastic, and I loved the way Abercrombie hits us with multiple twists throughout the book. Loyalty and treachery hang in balance and at every turn our main protagonists tip the scales in surprising ways. <br /><br />Rikke remained my favourite character throughout the entire trilogy. From A Little Hatred we watch Rikke as she comes out from behind her father’s shadow and becomes an absolute force not to be rivalled with, yet even when she finally gains power in her own right, her fundamental caring personality wars with what is best for her people. She vies for fairness, when her people look to her to rule with a firm hand. Rikke is the most vulnerable, and heartfelt character within the book, she genuinely cares for the people who show her loyalty, no matter the deeds they’ve done. Abercrombie has always explored found families within his books, and Rikke’s relationship with Shivers and Isern-i-Phail, which goes from strength to strength in Wisdom of Crowds, made for one of the weirdest but most sincere found families within the series. Not to mention how entertaining they were too, Abercrombie absolutely hit the nail on the head with the banter between these characters.<br /><br />‘Did I do the right thing, Shivers?’<br />‘You’re asking the wrong man, I reckon.’<br />‘I’m asking the only one I trust.’<br />‘‘Cause I done so much o’ the wrong thing?’<br />‘Shows you know the difference, don’t it?’<br />‘Not sure there is one.’<br /><br />Savine was a character I had previously disliked but Abercrombie crafted her story arc so brilliantly that I couldn’t help but care for her in this last instalment. Her desire for self preservation and self profit never quite leaves her, but without giving away too much, her priorities change and her motivations, at least on some level, are for a better life all round. This sense of purpose in my opinion made her a much more likeable character. <br /><br />My sympathies fell wholeheartedly with Gunnar Broad, a man with a history of warfare, always called to do the deeds no one else was willing to do, a man utterly haunted by his past. Once again Gunnar’s vow to keep out of trouble, and to ensure his family’s safety means he has to sacrifice his own morality, his own inner peace, and do what must be done. This time it seems executing the nobles falls in his hands, and now driven to a constant state of drunkenness, Gunnar struggles to find a way to end this cycle before it destroys him entirely.<br /><br />“He drank again, spirit burning his sore gullet. It was like taking the lenses off his mind. Make everything a blur. So he didn’t have to see Liddy’s face, or May’s. Didn’t have to think of what they’d say. Didn’t have to put ‘em next to what he was now. Didn’t have to fear what he might do to ‘em. Made it easier, being drunk. Or did it make it easier to have something to blame?”<br /><br />I also felt for Orso and Vick who both seem to get the raw deal throughout Wisdom of Crowds. However, no matter what was thrown at Orso, he kept his quick witted nonchalant attitude, and I loved him all the more for it. Vick was perhaps the only character trying her utmost best to solve the disaster of the uprising she had played a part in, perhaps the only character to feel remorse. This may be a dark book set in a brutal violent world, but even so, these characters all still withheld their charm.<br /><br />“They’re monsters,” Orso heard her whisper.<br />‘I almost wish they were,’ he muttered. ‘That would be easier. But they’re just people.’<br />‘They’re the worst people I ever saw.’<br />‘Of course they are. We hanged all the best ones.’<br /> <br />Abercrombie will always be the staple example for why I love the Grimdark genre, his stories are never one dimensional. In his world, his characters and his plot, there are no good deeds, no bad deeds, no heroes, no villains and certainly no justice. There are only people with reasons. <br /><br />‘Take it far enough, freedom becomes chaos. The voice of the people… is just noise. It is the blather of the lunatics in the madhouse. It is the squeal of the pigs in the slaughterhouse. It is a choir of morons. Most of them don’t even know what they want, let alone how to get it.’<br /><br />The Wisdom of Crowds is a worthy ending, one in which Abercrombie excels himself and proves to be a wizard of words. Although I am sad to say goodbye to these characters and the world of the First Law, the ‘Great Change’ is now upon us readers too, and I can’t wait to see what stories Abercrombie will conjure up next.<br /><br />ARC provided by Will at Gollancz in exchange for an honest review.

"Without a single hesitation, I can confidently say this is one of the best fantasy trilogies I’ve read in years and this final book was absolutely magnificent. <br /><br />Now all I want to do is drop everything and reread the original trilogy lol",5
"Plot twists and more plot twists. Wow. I thought I was case hardened to the point where surprises are rare, but this story shocked me more than once. This review is spoiler-free so I won't get into details, but in a way I guess I should've seen a couple of them coming. The author definitely knows how to play the long game with his plot and keep the twists coming right up to the end.<br /><br />It's a rare gift when an author can truly build to an ending like this. It was satisfying without becoming cliche. The rounded nature of the characters left me wondering who was really good or evil, what justice would actually look like, and whether (much like life) it was a sad and ironic combination of the contrasting elements. <br /><br />The themes really are revealed in the changes the characters go through. A look at them in the beginning of the series and then again here at the end is a shocking, horrifying, and an all too real grasp of verisimilitude in the form of a before and after snapshot of the human psyche. One of the things I really like about these characters, even the evil ones, is I am left with a disturbing sense that after understanding the context of their actions I may well have done the same thing. I like to believe not, but part of making these characters likable was making them relatable and it is clearly a trademark of this author's style. Grimdark with character.<br /><br />Five star finale.",5
"A bit disappointing in the sense that the pre-release hype of twists etc turned out to be quite predictable as whoever you expect to live and rule, lives and rules, whoever you expect to die, dies and of course, nothing in the big picture is settled as the finale - while ending conclusively this series pretty much as the original trilogy ended except with the next generation now in charge - shows that more books in the series are sure to follow with the next-next-generation now and maybe for once there will be genuine twists; this being said, the prose, irony and dark humor was as expected and made the book enjoyable to a large extent but it also made it a repeat of the previous many similar books in the series and I think that the original Glotka-NineFingers-Jezal etc beats the cast here",3

</b><br><br><b>""Arrrrrgh"" </b>oh the pain. Please don't for one second think that my pain has been caused by reading the final installment in Joe Abercrombie's scintillating <b>Age of Madness series</b>, the Wisdom of Crowds. If you're apprehensive about what ending is in store for our beloved characters then don't be. It's simply the fact that this book marks the end of our time within the world of the <b>First Law</b>. And that leaves a huge void in my life. A void that cannot be filled by beer, football or other inferior fantasy series.<br><br>Seriously, Joe Abercrombie is the reason I'm even reading fantasy.

By making amazing characters the focus of the story and mixing pulsating action with lots of dark comedy and perfectly timed heartfelt moments. <b>He really is the Tarantino of the fantasy genre</b>.<br><br><b>
  <i>""Wisdom is not a premium, madness is the fashion, the balance sheets are all torn up and the friends that were assets have become liabilities.""</i>
</b><br><br>But if you're reading this review then you're probably up with all the things this fantastic series has to offer. So you just need to know if this book is any good. Yes it is... brilliant in fact. End of review...<br><br><b>... oh you want more.</b><br><br>The previous book,<b> The Trouble with Peace</b>, ended on the verge of The Great Change, and this one kicks off exactly where it left off with full on civil war and open rebellion.  Yes, the oppressors have become the oppressed and finding out just how equal we all are when the chips are down.<br>The Breakers and Burners have continued their determination to break the system and are now destroying the city and their places of work.  The<br>Age of Madness is now looking a very apt title for where this series is at. <br><br><img src=""https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1632748932i/31978794._SX540_.jpg"" class=""gr-hostedUserImg"" loading=""lazy""><br><br>By now we all know this author's strengths and he's honed them to a fine art. As per usual, Abercrombie treats us to phenomenal characterisation with a keen insight on the human condition.  Good people commit awful acts, and awful people become heroes.  It's all a matter of perspective in Joe's books and everything depends on what side of the fence you're on or what end of a blade. It's great to spend time with these morally grey characters and you can't help but wonder if you sometimes see a bit of yourself reflected there. Hopefully not too much though!<br><br><b>Leo Dan Brock</b>, left shattered at the end of the last book, is determined to become a new hero of this volatile age, while his wife <b>Savine </b>is suffering a complete character makeover as she switches her passion for profit to simple survival.

That's as far as I'm going though and I'll leave it up to yourself to find out which of the characters come out on top as they struggle to keep their heads above water. Suffice to say that Abercrombie works his magic by keeping us absolutely enthralled regardless of which POV is being used.<br><br><img src=""https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1632749018i/31978807._SY540_.jpg"" class=""gr-hostedUserImg"" loading=""lazy""><br><br>And while we're on the subject of magic, the quality of writing is absolutely magnificent.  Joe is punching write at the top of the fantasy genre and for pure readability it's up there with the very best.  It's dark, it's violent and very humorous and the prose just draw you in, take tight hold of your eye balls and don't let go until the very end.<br><br>My only criticism is that one characters arc for me was a bit unrealistic and things changed a little bit to rapidly and without much adversity.  I'd of like to have seen victory earned particularly when you consider what they were up against.

</b><br><br>But that's a very small criticism amongst all the praise I have for this book and the series as a whole. It's been a huge part of my life for the last six months and I'm going to miss it.  Far more than all those ex's that dumped me.  But before I go you'll want to know if Joe landed the ending? Of course he bloody did and you'll be stoked to know he left plenty of threads open for a sequel.  That's what I'm hoping for anyway. I can't cope without First Law in my life.

I only finished the first law original trilogy last year and this year I tackled the rest of the books. I had it planned so that by the time this book is released, I would have read everything and I think the plan was a major success for me. I always had a good feeling about this series and looks like I was right. I also should mention that I sometimes speed through books which may affect the comprehension (less so with contemporaries but it happens with dense fantasy stories) and that was the case with The Trouble with Peace. I decided to read the two summaries Abercrombie provided on his website which were life saving and I am 100% I would not have enjoyed the story this much without them (Honestly more authors should be doing this because it will have a huge impact on ratings and sales). Reading those summaries made me pump my rating of book two because I did miss a few things when I read it. I also used a map I saw on twitter which was fan made and it also really helped me as a visual person. I read The Wisdom of Crowds slowly and steadily and it really paid off!<br /><br />The story takes place after the shocking events at the ending of book two and it is all about “The Great Change”. I think the beginning was like a psychological study of communities and how they are affected by change which was amusing and hilarious at the same time.<br /><br /><blockquote>
  <i>
    <b>“Before we can feed the people’s bellies,” agreed Risinau, “we must feed the people’s minds. Only with a government founded on sound principles of fairness and justice can they prosper!”</b>
  </i>
</blockquote><br /><br />The writing is Abercrombie at his best, earlier this year I said that Best Served Cold is my favorite book by the author and I thought it would not be changing anytime soon but this book proved me wrong and took the crown (pun intended). The writing is just brilliant because it involves multiple POVs but they are well balanced and it was interesting from start to finish. There were a ton of quotes that I liked and highlighted, I always said that Abercombie is a master of dialogue and this was not an exception to this rule. This book gave me all kinds of emotions and I know it takes real skill to evoke my emotions.<br /><br />The characters were all great! I did not think that I will love them this much but I did care about the main characters: Savine, Orso, Leo and Rikke are all memorable and precious characters to me now. Glokta is still my favorite character in this world but those characters are next to him on the ladder. The characters in this book are unpredictable and are all traitors and serve their own goods. I don’t know if there was any character that I can consider pure and good but that’s what makes this very fresh and intriguing and it also what makes Abercrombie deserve the title Lord Grimdark!<br /><br /><blockquote>
  <i>
    <b>“Well, at least one of us has something long.” She started forwards and jabbed her little finger in his face. “Guess we know why they call you the Nail now!”</b>
  </i>
</blockquote><br /><br />I always mentioned that plot in The First Law world is slow and relatively less good than the characters and prose. I can say that the plot in this series was excellent and in this book specifically it was mind-boggling. It was really hard to predict and things kept happening left and right and the little details are what makes this perfect!<br /><br />The world building is not very different from the previous books but it is the Great Change book and everything was involved in this and it was fascinating to see how the world itself is affected by this.<br /><br /><blockquote>
  <i>
    <b>“You let one sheep pick its own path,” said Isern, “and ’fore you know it the whole herd’s got opinions.”</b>
  </i>
</blockquote><br /><br /><b>Summary:</b> Books like this are the reason I am not generous with 5 stars because books need to be almost perfect to deserve those and The Wisdom of Crowds is one of those books. An interesting story from start to finish, great prose that is eloquent yet funny. Characters that you love and hate at the same time and a story line that is so well thought of. This is going into my favorites shelf too and will definitely be in my top 5 reads of this year!!",5
"<b>Check out my Booktube channel at: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWpzzPo-rrt4_KJHHP8i6Qw"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">The Obsessive Bookseller</a></b><br><br>[4.5/5 stars] I’m going to have to come to grips with the fact that I’m current with Abercrombie’s adult fantasy novels. I knew this day would come, and prepared for it a bit, but it still hurts.<br><br>Is he now my top author? He certainly has been creeping up the board lately – knocking down authors I thought would hold those spots forever. I’m not sure he’s quite managed to dethrone Robin Hobb, but damn, he has made a case for himself.<br><br>As the finale in the trilogy, Wisdom of Crowds had all of that amazing momentum I’d been hoping for. All of those moments that make you stop what your reading and just go, “wow.” There we’re so many fun plot tools used in this story that I don’t usually see done well, but here they were executed flawlessly. And I think that’s in no small part due to how rich, real, and rounded his characters are. Real people are dynamic, complicated creatures who do irrational things all the time. In books, however, it’s really difficult to convey that without making your characters come across inconsistent or under-developed. Abercrombie’s brilliant character work allowed him to showcase some amazing scenes that are now among my favorites from the whole saga. And it made this final book so, so satisfying to read.<br><br>Not that I think we’ve seen the last of the First Law world. There was definitely some compelling setup for more to come, but as I understand it, that’s a ways out.<br><br>Many people have asked me how this trilogy holds up compared to the books that came before it. I think it’s definitely more in line with the slow-burn, politically-driven novels we got in the first trilogy rather than the more action-packed stand-alones. Arguably, this was the most difficult one to read yet, as the characters are frustrating, the situation complicated and brutal (in true Abercrombie fashion), and there were several points where I both loved (because of appreciation of the craft) and hated (the awful things that happen) what I was reading. It was evoking and amazing and horrible, and I really would love nothing more than to be put through all of it again in his next book. Us Abercrombie readers are a bit masochistic, is all I’m sayin’.<br><br>Recommendations: I wasn’t a die-hard Abercrombie fan with his initial trilogy. I WAS a die-hard Glokta fan within that, but it took seeing Abe’s writing strengthen to brilliance in Best Served Cold before I was won over. And now it’s all I can do with my life not to become an blathering fangirl. If like me you thought First Law was just okay after the first trilogy, keep reading!

This ending was perfection! And I love Savine- she's such an amazing character.,5
"What I love most about this series is also what I struggle with the hardest: that Abercrombie holds up a mirror to humanity in all its terrible 'glory'. As much as we might wish that this opportunity to <i>see</i> offers us a picture through a glass darkly, what Abercrombie shows us is the reality of who and what we are. I've said before that he is a student of history, and nowhere is that more clear than in The Wisdom of Crowds. For anyone who isn't sure, 'wisdom' is not how the quote actually goes. It's all one big joke, a smirk, a snarky commentary on the state of things - and not just in the First Law world. If at any time you think things can't get worse, that people couldn't fall much further, then know that you, and they, have not hit the bottom just yet. The ultimate truth? That there's always further to fall. History never ends. People do not change. And there's always someone pulling the strings in the background...<br /><br />Chucking in a wizard or two made this fantasy, but it's the characterisation, the gritty reality that makes it magic.

"<b>A cutting satire of political revolution with wonderfully dark humor and a grim mess of an outcome that will leave you wanting more.</b><br /><br />'The Wisdom of Crowds' is Abercrombie's most political book to date - some of it subtle, some of it banged over your head with the flat of a blade before it guts you with sharp commentary. 'The Trouble with Peace' ended on the cusp of The Great Change, and I thought 'Wisdom' would take some time before the Change itself became the centerpiece to the story. But there was no time wasted, as the big battle was gotten out of the way early. I was surprised to see a lengthy 'Little People' section (a consistent favorite of mine) occurred so early in chapter 2 when the narrative hopped around POVs during the madness of a battle. It was at that point in time when I realized that the book wasn't going to focus on the war itself, like his standalone, 'The Heroes,' but rather the aftermath of it, while attempting to answer the question on everyone's mind -- <i>what now?</i><br /><br />And as expected, it all turns to shit. The Great Change is a change alright, but if you think it's for the better, then this must be your first rodeo. 'Here comes the new boss, same as the old boss,' rings true as new figures come into power, and the sadly laughable truth of hopeful democracy versus the greed of plutocracy comes to light. And with it, the horrific violence of an angry, repressed people who have decades of scores to settle. <br /><br />In the North, both Rikke and Black Calder are attempting to out-maneuver each other for full control of the North. Although I love Rikke as a character, I found this to be the weakest section of the book. The planning and execution of their battle strategies and war preparations felt like we’ve gone down these paths before. It’s all very well written, but plot-wise it didn’t feel that different from many other North battles we’ve read since The Blade Itself.<br /><br />There are tragic characters, such as Gunnar Broad and King Orso, who try to be good but cannot escape their cruel fates. There are characters who were heroes of days gone by that morph into despicable beings by book's end. There are long-simmering revelations, and loose ends that are tied. You will find that some people who should have learned the most will never learn. And there is an exciting passage toward the end of the story that leaves me thinking that the author has the bones of the next trilogy already in mind.<br /><br />Although Abercrombie's plot twists were a bit predictable this time around, 'Wisdom' easily stuck the landing of this dark, grim, political satire, rife with Shakespearean tragedies and sneaky gallows humor...<br /><br />… and they all lived happily ever after!<br /><br />4.5 / 5",4
"<i> The Wisdom of Crowds </i> serves as a riveting conclusion to a well-written fantasy trilogy full of twists and turns. For some strange reason, this book was not nominated for the Goodreads Choice Awards in fantasy which blows my mind. I picked up this book almost immediately after I finished the previous book since it had cliffhangers galore. I knew I was not going to get a fairy tale happy ending (still was hoping for it though), but the journey is what is important with books such as these. <br><br><img src=""https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1646498963i/32650936.jpg"" class=""gr-hostedUserImg"" loading=""lazy""> <br><br>The previous book ended with surprise turns aplenty. Stour Nightfall, King of the North, was betrayed, crippled, and given to Rikke who cleverly maneuvered her army into taking the North instead of joining the ill thought rebellion of the dan Brocks. Leo dan Brock lost not only the rebellion but parts of his body as well. Savine had to beg her brother, Orso, to not execute her husband, Leo, after the rebellion is put down. King Orso has quelled the rebellion of the nobles and the army from the North and rides home to the Union after a successful campaign. Meanwhile, Pike, who is now the head of the inquisition, reveals to Vick that he is in fact also the true power behind the Breakers and Burners who rose up in the first book. <br><br><img src=""https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1605955542ra/30407374.gif"" class=""gr-hostedUserImg"" loading=""lazy""> <br><br>The novel is kind of hard to summarize without giving too much away. The story picks up with tens of thousands of workers and commoners marching to the capital in a revolution hoping to overthrow the government that throttled them. King Orso becomes imprisoned and the dan Brocks are released from their captivity while the nobles who were in rebellion get a seat at the table. <br><br><img src=""https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1646498963ra/32650939.gif"" class=""gr-hostedUserImg"" loading=""lazy""> <br><br>The everyday man celebrates his freedom and not having to pay taxes any more so everything is just peachy. Except it is not. People are starving and cold since there is no one to work. Problems arise when a psychotic leader of the revolution takes charge and starts executing people by the multitude with little to no evidence. Pike’s concern is not to control the anarchy he created but to destroy the banks that control the nation from behind the curtain. <br><br><img src=""https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1478993365ra/21137701.gif"" class=""gr-hostedUserImg"" loading=""lazy""> <br><br>Orso must survive being paraded around like a fool. Savine wants nothing more than to protect her children. Leo wants to accomplish something despite losing his prowess as a warrior and his looks. (Might be hard since he is a moron. Did I mention I hate Leo in the previous book review?) Vick has to come with terms with where she stands when it comes to the revolution. Meanwhile, Clover and Broad exist. <br><br><img src=""https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1646498963ra/32650932.gif"" class=""gr-hostedUserImg"" loading=""lazy""> <br><br>Meanwhile, Tricky Rikke of the North tries to consolidate her power and keep her allies united before Black Calder can take back the north for himself and to get his son, Stour. She faces hurdles as Black Calder, a shrewd tactician, gathers more and more allies including Bayaz the magi. Bayaz is the real power behind the Union and other surrounding nations as he founded most of them hundreds of years ago and controls the banks which control the purse strings of most of the world. <br><br><img src=""https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1646498963ra/32650934.gif"" class=""gr-hostedUserImg"" loading=""lazy""> <br><br><i> The Trouble With Peace</i> started out slow, but ended strongly. <i> The Wisdom of Crowds</i> starts out fast and doesn’t let off the brake until the last hundred or so pages. The writing and the prose are again on point. We experience the revolution in all of its glory with a chapter from many viewpoints of background characters in all walks of life who see the hope for its success and the horrors of it. The author includes a lot of the side characters in this book with a bunch of development. You can truly notice the difference in how almost all of the characters have developed compared to the first book. <br><br>This book really makes for a good character study. I didn’t like Savine in the second book even though I did in the first, but she went back to being my favorite character of the series with this one. She recognizes her faults and builds on them while surviving and refusing to bow to the whims of anyone. Rikke is no longer the scared girl from before. She has a kingdom to protect while standing up to and commanding some of the strongest warriors in an inevitable battle that decides the fate of the north. The battle was especially well written in this book. Black Calder though did not feel like he does in previous books. <br><br><img src=""https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1646498963i/32650940.jpg"" class=""gr-hostedUserImg"" loading=""lazy""> <br><br>Vick comes to terms with herself and decides she can’t be only taking orders mindlessly anymore. She orchestrates a plot to undo some of the damage and became a character I enjoyed reading as she had more personality in this book. Poor Orso finally thought he could accomplish something until he trades one captor for another. He really grows as a character and thinks of others and his people while holding out hope his army can free him. I did enjoy his pov, but Savine’s pov was my favorite. Broad and Clover were just kind of there for me in this book. I think Broad is probably the least interesting pov for me in the series even though he has the most interesting background (some readers have a theory he is related to the Bloody Nine). <br><br><img src=""https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1646498963i/32650935._SX540_.jpg"" class=""gr-hostedUserImg"" loading=""lazy""> <br><br>For the last POV, we have Leo Brock. He was insufferable to me in the previous book and an annoyance in the first. Leo finally does some introspection and sees how things should have been different. Yeah, he will change right? <input type=""checkbox"" class=""spoiler__control"" aria-label=""The following text has been marked spoiler.

In fact, he has become even worse. I hated him so much at the end of the book. Savine maneuvered it so that the sniveling worm did not quite get his happy ending so I got a little solace out of that. </label> Leo makes the choice to get into politics to help steer the broken nation in the right direction. Of course, that introspection did not help his fragile ego and didn’t get rid of his closeted racism towards foreigners. <br><br><img src=""https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1646498963ra/32650933.gif"" class=""gr-hostedUserImg"" loading=""lazy""> <br><br>I really enjoyed this book in all its glory. I know a lot of his fans are diehards of the first book trilogy and want an adaption of it, but I see this trilogy as being easier to adapt and maybe capturing a more mainstream audience with political intrigue. The promise of the future to come at the ending with the chapter at Bayaz’s compound makes me excited for future books too. The difference between this book and the last was how I saw the twists coming, yet that didn’t dull my enjoyment of the book. Clever Sand dan Glockta is all I can say on that note. <br><br><img src=""https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1646498963ra/32650937.gif"" class=""gr-hostedUserImg"" loading=""lazy""> <br><br>Joe Abercrombie pervaded tropes again in this book and foreshadowed deaths of certain characters in the earlier parts of the trilogy. Characters that have been with readers for multiple books outside of this trilogy do not all survive. The story is definitely an emotional roller coaster especially when you realize certain things have been foreshadowed the whole time. A lot of the characters are of differing shades of grey where they aren’t all just good or evil. The characters feel real and are motivated by each of their ambitions even if they don’t see the folly of it. <br><br><img src=""https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1563825998ra/27869539.gif"" class=""gr-hostedUserImg"" loading=""lazy""> <br><br>The whole trilogy is a treat. It shows how much of a great writer Joe Abercrombie has become. He doesn’t need the best fighters as povs anymore to capture his audience. The book still occupies my thoughts weeks after finishing it (if I say more about the why then it would ruin the story. I recommend this series and pretty much any of his books to fantasy lovers alike. <br><br><img src=""https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1646498963i/32650938._SY540_.png"" class=""gr-hostedUserImg"" loading=""lazy""> <br><br>Find this book and other titles within <a href=""https://sierra-app.wrlsweb.org/iii/cas/login?service=https://encore.wrlsweb.org:443/iii/encore/j_acegi_cas_security_check&amp;lang=eng"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">our catalog</a>.</[""br""]></[""br""]></[""br""]></[""br""]></[""br""]></[""br""]></[""br""]></[""br""]></[""br""]></[""br""]></[""br""]></[""br""]></[""br""]></[""br""]></[""br""]></[""br""]></[""br""]></[""br""]></[""br""]></[""br""]></[""br""]></[""br""]></[""br""]></[""br""]></[""br""]></[""br""]></[""br""]></[""br""]></[""br""]></[""br""]></[""br""]></[""br""]></[""br""]></[""br""]></[""br""]></[""br""]></[""br""]></[""br""]></[""br""]></[""br""]></[""br""]></[""br""]></[""br""]></[""br""]></[""br""]></[""br""]></[""br""]></[""br""]></[""br""]></[""br""]>",5

  <i>""You picked apt names for yourselves... You are Burners. You build nothing, you make nothing. All you can do is destroy. The old regime was rotten. The people cried for freedom. What have you given them?... Corpses...""</i>
</blockquote><br /><br />The Wisdom of Crowds like all Joe Abercrombie's books is a living example of nihilism. I don't find myself a nihilistic person, but I can't deny the truth of his many quotes:<br /><br /><blockquote>“...if enough people got angry enough, they could change things. Now anger was the answer to everything.”</blockquote><br /><br /><blockquote>“But here’s the sorry truth – if you really don’t want a thing, you don’t have to keep telling yourself so.”</blockquote><br /><br /><blockquote>“One must keep a close eye on the current definitions. To be unpatriotic would be terrible. To be patriotic in the wrong way could be fatal.”</blockquote><br /><br /><blockquote>“I hardly know the right terms for anything these days. Even if I did, I fear they would be the wrong ones by tomorrow morning.”</blockquote><br /><br /><blockquote>“Evil is not the opposite of good. It is what we call another man’s notion of good when it differs from ours.”</blockquote><br /><br /><blockquote>“...what really happened doesn't matter half so much as what people want to hear.”</blockquote><br /><br /><blockquote>“Unity and respect, it seemed, were only for those who did as they were told.”</blockquote><br /><br /><blockquote>“Right things, wrong things, well...it's all a matter of where you stand. Every choice is good for some, bad for others.”</blockquote><br /><br /><blockquote>“Doubts and regrets, they're the cost of casting a shadow. The only folk without 'em are the dead.”</blockquote><br /><br />Strip away the fantasy elements and this story reads like modern events in the United States at least. People screaming for change with no real plan how to do so. Everything gaining new definitions and those caught using the old ones find themselves punished for it. People who would rather hear a good story than the truth. It's frightening looking at it objectively. That's undoubtedly Abercrombie's style. He shows people's nature as he sees it. Those who show mercy are made to suffer for it. Most are manipulated and suffer due to the choices of the powerful. The characters are not likeable people, but they are real. No choice made throughout this book or series is truly that shocking because faced with horror, most of us would choose only to help ourselves and those closest to us. As is often the case, The Wisdom of Crowds has me pondering the world and feeling sad about much of what I see.<br /><br />3.5 out of 5 stars",4
"Darkity dark, dark, dark. <br /><br />Dark like Goya's ""Dog Buried In Sand"" is dark. Dark like J.G. Ballard's ""Atrocity Exhibition"" or David Lynch's ""Eraserhead"".

"When the blurb on the back of a book features a quote from Nick Cave—the man who utilized exactly 236 different terms for vagina and masturbation in his wonderful novel <a href=""https://goodreads.com/book/show/6389257.The_Death_of_Bunny_Munro"" title=""The Death of Bunny Munro by Nick Cave"" rel=""noopener"">The Death of Bunny Munro</a>—calling your book repulsive, you know you have managed some kind of achievement…<br /><br /><i>The Consumer</i> is a collection of grotesque and scatologically unsound vignettes written over a span of ten years by the cosmic guru of teeth-gnashing but melodious gothic drone, M. Gira. Like the music gifted to us by the band Swans (which Gira masterminds), the pieces in this collection tackle a wide range of topics guaranteed never to be uttered in any 19th century ladies’ salon, such as rape, incest, sodomy, murder, self-mutilation, torture,cannibalism, animal cruelty, pedophilia, necrophilia, coprophagia, gang bangs, masturbation, bestiality and probably a few other indecencies guaranteed to make the tender-hearted reader blush if he or she weren’t too busy squirming in their own vomit. But where Gira’s music has the boon of lush and magnificent musical arrangements and utterly ear-pleasing post-punk/rock/whatever aesthetics, all we get here is words on the page, which makes for a more precarious experience. <br /><br />The first half of the collection is a series of short-story-ish pieces composed in the early to mid-90’s, and while several are particularly impressive pieces—such as the title story, “The Consumer, The Rotting Pig,”—all of the stories suffer from a heavy reliance on packing every sentence with disturbing imagery, which results in an over-kill of the preposition “like.” In general, every story is written in a clinically distant style and relay hallucinatory threads of narrative told (usually) from the 1st person perspective of a self-loathing, mentally and physically impotent male. And while one of Swans great attributes is their mastery of repetition, here it only works well some of the time, making it difficult to distinguish any of the stories between one another. <br /><br />The real pleasure for me came from the second half of the book, entitled “Various Traps, Some Weaknesses, Etc,” which collects much shorter and less over-written snippets of prose penned ten years prior to the first half of the book. Many of the stories in this half feature the same titles as songs from Swans as well as lyrics, giving the impression that these writings were Gira’s brainstorms for material to be better realized in musical form. While still pretty much indistinguishable from one another, these pieces are much shorter (some barely longer than a page) and can be read through in a mad dash, which gives the writing a certain heft, like riding across the back of some horrible, galactic beast rutting its way through endless dimensions of flesh, viscera and filth.<br /><br />The overlying theme of this book is the way in which men and women yearn to consume one another—usually through extreme acts of sexual violence—in order to make up for their own moral and spiritual deficiencies, and Gira certainly goes about his objective correlative with a monomaniacal determination and without compromise. However, I can really only recommend this book for the most diehard of Swans fans (which, devoutly, I am) or for admirers of the most hardcore of transgressive fiction (I enjoy the occasional imbibing of the fucked-up). A profoundly unpleasant book—which is exactly the author’s intent.<br /><br /><b>BONUS FEATURES:</b><br /><br />Of course I can’t pass up an opportunity to throw in some of my favorite songs by Swans!<br /><br /><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nI5ua3SOKrY"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">”The Great Annihilator”</a><br /><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2bMsYb9P-k"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">”A Little God in My Hands</a><br /><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4mQxGXxU2M"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">”Mother of the World”</a><br /><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bCUZX6g8BM"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">”I Am the Sun”</a><br /><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYfqiW7P3lw"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">”Better Than You”</a><br />",3

When an image moves through my nervous system, it's with the predatory greed of an intruder. My body's laid open, transparent, defenseless. Each second of time is an individual insect feeding on my body.""<br /><br />""I can see my soul hovering there in front of me in the flood of light and colour, a swarm of demon insects, bad breath made visible. It's sucking into itself like light and matter retreating into the vortex of a black hole.""<br /><br />""Every thought that advances through the greased tunnels of my brain carries with it its own hungry negation. I'm flooded with empathy."" <br /><br />""Like a drugged priest holding up a chalice of Christ's intoxicating blood, he raised up his bottle of codeine-laced cough syrup in both hands and sucked the liquid in.

The orifice was a sticky cherry red wound gouged out of his pulpy flesh."" <br /><br /><br />... I mean.",5
"Swans’ frontman M. Gira’s short story collection, The Consumer, is a dark, wet compendium of every atrocity imaginable (rape, incest, pedophilia, scatological hijinks of all manners, etc., etc., etc.), half-heartedly molded into words on the page in a seemingly perfunctory way, or maybe some kind of transgressive divination, the author hoping to glean sense and meaning off the shit and cum on the walls. <br /><br />However, though most of the over 40 stories featured here only fizzle, gnashing fake teeth, giving airs of unintentional comedy and edgelord journal scribblings, I do believe the collection boasts one truly impressive feature: Its sincere recognition of the technique and craft behind transgressive fiction.<br /><br />You see, I paused my reading of this book for about a year because I could not make sense of it before. It read to me only as cindery, scorched words that served their incendiary purpose decades ago and now lay abandoned, in the indefinite oblivion of “out of print” (reading about how the quality of the stories was a big driving factor in Gira’s decision to never republish this was certainly not encouraging). <br /><br />Now with a year gone by—a year bloated with over a hundred aggressively disturbing books read throughout—I’d like to believe I’ve returned to this collection somewhat wiser, more acclimated to the tradition Gira pays homage to. Though at first, the recalcitrant ethics of a noise band frontman would lead one to believe we’re in for relentless iconoclasm and miserable, self-hating confessional poetry with unconventional form, instead, after studying the tradition of transgression myself, I see Gira as a fully competent writer who understood (back then at least) and knew through and through the gleeful turns of phrase that demarcate violence, the wondrous exploration of the grime behind the curtain, and of the constant need to traverse taboos and boundaries and see what, if anything, is reflected in that grime—in short, someone accustomed to this devilish art of shock and outrage, with a firm grasp on its history and sense of style, guided by a heart full of rotted debauchery to spare.<br /><br />It was alright. 3.5 stars.",3
"Got sooooooo excited to hear this talked about on the QUIET PLACE podcast, one of my all time favorite (or at least most challenging and memorable) transgressive story collections. Michael Gira is a genius and SWANS will always be his most important artistic contribution to mankind, but this book shows that his well of creativity and willingness to push it applies in all forms of art he practices.",5
so overwrought and boring. Gross for the sake of being gross. Everything seemed to be written just for the shock value and I don't feel like forcing myself to continue. DNF at about 40%,0
"Absolute crap. Thought there could have eventually been some reason behind the graphic depictions of incest, paedophilia, murder, and feces but no. I quit reading half way. Gira tries to shock with his overly descriptive ramblings, but only succeeds in revealing his psychopathy and his need to be neutered, Haldolled up, diapered, and institutionalized. I've never been for censorship but am rethinking my position on that. Don't read it. It is disgusting, while still somehow being boring.<br />On a positive note, if you do own this book, it could be useful as kindling, toilet paper, confetti for parties, or in crafts like papier mâché.",1
"Best to be honest and say I read this because I'm a Swans fan. And the thing is, yeah, Gira can't really write - I think the way he's disowned the book and writes it off entirely as juvenalia is a little much, but yeah the actual content isn't by any stretch good writing. It is a really good look into how he translates the Swans aesthetic into a different medium, and the writing does have the atmosphere of violence and negativity that's so intense in the band's work. So really this is for Swans/Gira fanatics interested in his total body of work as an artist, and not something that I'd necessarily read entirely on its own merits. It isn't absolutely terrible though, or even hard to get through, and there are some inspired moments that might stick with you. Also, I like to put on the Ecstatic Peace tape of him reading from this to make people uncomfortable at parties. ",4
"So, I read this partially because I fell in love with Swans as a band. It’s outta print but PDFs are everywhere online, so I’d say it’s worth checking out if only for the first few.<br /><br />There is one huge problem: Every other sentence is some in-depth metaphor. It’s cool for the first five stories and some of the shorter ones, but it becomes pretentious and suffocating on stories like “The Consumer, Rotting Pig” and “The Young Man That Hid His Body inside a Pig.” Honestly, I got bored during both of these and often lost track of what the hell was going on. Even during the shorter short stories, it sometimes became overwhelming reading some of his metaphors/ similes. The abuse of “like” became exhausting.<br /><br /><br /><br />Some of the stories are r/trashyboners material, but most of them are sick, disgusting, and vile. Some made me feel a little disturbed, others just made me feel empty, and a handful were just sad. Unfortunately, The first five are amazing, but it slowly becomes not so interesting from there, especially in the second half of the book. The stories become only a page or so long and it’s like Gira ran out of ideas. They get a little boring and stupid after Raping a Slave. Starting with The Money’s Flesh, I only kept reading because I had made it that far and loved the first five<br /><br />My final rating is 1.5 stars because I enjoyed reading it and love the first five short stories. The rest aren’t good at all. If you read this, don't buy an overpriced version online and just read the first five. The rest aren't worth it.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Here are some of the examples that best show his weird imagery. They’re somewhat funny to read because they’re so over the top.<br /><br /><br /><br />“""Oh Baby! Oh Baby! Do it!"" someone demanded of the screen. ""I yam! I yam!"" <br /><br />came the mock-reply, followed by a horrible liquid squishing, as if a hundred greased orifices were farting at once.”<br /><br /><br /><br />“The trucks shook the earth down through the cliffs to the beach, migrating along the road like a thundering diaspora of stricken prehistoric beasts, roaring their agony up at the sinking sky.”<br /><br /><br /><br />“The cold air brought mucus to his nose. It expanded out from his nostrils like a child's bubble gum stretched further with each breath and finally rested on his upper lip - fresh larvae gener­ated by an industrious insect.”",2
"This book was definitely something, and by something, I mean a hellhole. Seriously, don’t read it if you have some kind of self-respect, because it’s not worth it.<br /><br />There are two parts to this book, which marks two time periods of when the stories were made.<br /><br />The first part was straight-up awful, both content and writing-wise. One of the topics that Mr. Gira loved to revisit was children and rape, most of the time the two in the same story. Other than that I felt like it’s an edgelord’s attempt at sounding poetic. The writing style made it super hard to concentrate but to be honest, maybe it’s for the better that I didn’t understand a few of the stories.<br /><br />The second part was slightly better. While the contents were still dark and twisted, the writing style was easier to read, while still being raw and shoving it into your face. There were also stories that were clearly inspired by his own life. Such as the story “The Young Boy”.<br /><br />I don’t know what I expected when stumbling upon this book, but it was definitely worse than my expectations. I think it’s quite overrated and made me ask if the people who rated it 4 and 5 stars really thought it was that good or if they are just fans of the Swans and they just want to support the author. Whichever is the case, please learn from my mistake and don’t go near this book. You will probably regret it.<br /><br />Now if you’ll excuse me, I need to find a fluffy and cute story to cleanse my palette and just so I can sleep at night.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />You can find my reaction as I read this book at: <br /><a target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" href=""https://ohnobooks.wordpress.com/2021/08/15/i-read-the-consumer-by-michael-gira-so-you-dont-have-to/"">https://ohnobooks.wordpress.com/2021/...</a>",1
"Michael Gira from Swans and Angels of Light with his collection of short grotesqueries. If you are of the faint of heart you are bound to mutter phrases like ""why, I never"" and give up after the first story (if you even make it that far). One of my very favorites. ",5
"Easily the most grotesque and horrific writing I have ever experienced. And not for a single sentence does a single one of these stories let up. Nearly every sentence is a short and brutal ""I"" statement describing the hateful things the given character is doing or dreams of doing. The things described in the book often verge and cross over into the realm of the entirely absurd. But it doesn't matter because the book weaponizes your own head voice against you. By painting such horrific pictures in the first person, the visceral images lodge themselves in your brain and stay there long enough to feel like you imagined them. What a nightmare. ",4
"A drug induced psychosis and some nightmares. <br />Beautiful, dark, ugly, disturbing, filthy and poetic. Nothing I could say can really explain how is ""The Consumer"". It's like walking alone in a street at night, you don't know where you are and you're afraid. It's like sleeping in a disgusting motel, the mattress is filthy and yellow and there's syringes needles under your bed. This entire book is a vibe, a darkness and filth covering you, and swallowing you whole.",5
It's uneven--the second section of the book is comprised of writings that seem more tentative and sketch-like--but the first section contains some of the best transgressive short fiction I've ever read. Get it bound in the skin of an ex-lover and keep it in a shrine by the bed.,4
"People love this book or hate it.<br /><br />I love it because it's in-your-face. It's repugnant, it's vile. It's honest. And because it can evoke such strong emotions in people, I think it deserves a strong rating.<br /><br />Also, about half way through the book you can tell when the author switched from coke to smack. Good times.",5
"Hmm... okay...?<br /><br /><br />So, $500-1000 for an used paperback copy? And Henry Rollins was the guy behind its publishing? ""Just this time, I will judge a cult by its price"", I thought. And this was the way I came to know The Consumer. I didn't know Michael Gira or Swans prior reaching the existence of the book (actually, it all came in a single package -- must say I got really impressed by Swans, especially with most recent works). Then I checked on the cult closely. Readers gleefully descripting this work as an unstoppable flow of really awful things in a raw writing style. A light on the obscure face of human nature, bare naked in front of your eyes. Bold and beautiful at the same time.<br /><br />All this previous explanation is to justify my 2/5 rating. After reading the reviews, I expected literature par with Japanese cyberpunk from the 80s. Before reading The Consumer's first pages, I rewinded the stomach-turning experience I had first time watching Gaspar Noé’s Irreversible. So I didn't get shocked or feel disgusted by what someone of more delicate tastes would describe as ""gratuitious display of shocking things"", because I was prepared for it. <br /><br />Thing is, writing is bad. Both parts of the book feel like a juvenile writing rant after discovering underground avant-garde culture, being the second part substantially worse than the first. It could be only a raw writing style, sure, but it cannot send any message. If the intent was to shock, or to make us look at the socially concealed human nature, or anything, the writing does not deliver. The author’s style makes all those taboo themes opaque -- and at some times, almost cartoonish -- in a way it is even hard to keep focus while reading. The Consumer experience feels like receiving layers upon layers of empty discourse. And it only gets worse when one realizes the short stories repeat it selves in content and structure, killing any anticipation.",2
" <a href=""https://silentmotorist.media/2018/12/26/the-unreprinted-the-consumer-by-m-gira/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Full Review</a><br /><br />The Consumer is a dark and disturbing read, but an incredibly poetic and amazingly crafted one. The book is incredibly rare, but worth tracking down. People who are already fans of Swans should certainly read this, but I also highly recommend this to anyone seeking well-written transgressive literature.",5
"Vile to the point of concerning, expected nothing less from Gira as he delves into the straight ugly nature of human begins and his own twisted mind. At times repetitive, there’s still no one else I’d rather have take me by the hand and walk the streets of violent despair than him.",4
pretentious af,2
" Reading this book felt like looking at a contemporary art piece made of offal, fecal matter, blood and tears of 10,000 infants. It made no sense. And even though I love transgressive art, the shock value was very cheap here. Like a dollar store glue. It might get you high only if you have no tolerance to that shit. And don't get me even started about his writing. It is little godawful like, like, likelike, and like,like,likeinmyhandslikelikelikelikelikeasiflikelikeOHSHIT&amp;BLOOOODFOREVERLOVE!!!! Okay, I'm leaving meaning here, but I still believe public castration is a good idea.<br /><br />PS: From now on I'm going to picture 90s Gira as a mutant who uses crying infants as a boxing glove. Don't ask me how, ask him.",1
"A collection of short stories that examine the dark side of humanity, this book is not for the squeamish or easily offended. The author's writing style is fluid and beautiful, serving to intensify the images of violence, rape and incest he carefully constructs. He spins possession and fear in an erotic and horrifying manner, and you find yourself empathizing with the twisted side of humanity, as you are a meth head crawling into the corpse of a horse that you have just disemboweled, for safety.

"A glorious ...filthy...heart stammering,lip biting....eyes strewn with cathartic tears...sometimes hauntingly beautiful and sinuous...oft deeply scarring glimpse into the darkest dankest corners and excrement strewn gutters of the human psyche..A one of a kind tome.<br /><br />Nothing like Giras The Consumer exists,<br />truly unique and utterly visceral...the words on these pages will dwell within my mind forever..<br /><br />A MUST READ!<br /><br />Also of note! Gira is an incredible musician ,singer and artist as well...SWANS are absolutely one pf my favorite musicians of all time,so read this and listen ;)",5
"Was this gross? Yes. Was this shocking? Yes. Was this transgressive? Yes. But it wasn’t much more than that. After six or so stories it all kind of melted together into a shallow sludge of schlock. The vocabulary feels really derivative of Bataille (or at least Bataille’s translator), every character’s internality is the same, and most stories are so short there’s no plot. Just slightly different flavors of ew. It’s cheap. It’s boring. I wanted more from Gira ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ ",2
"Whew...yeah...what a read. <br /><br />If you suffer from mental illness of any kind, do not read this book.<br /><br />The Consumer brings a whole new meaning to the words ""grotesque"", ""offensive"", and ""depressing"". However, it is amazing well-written. It achieves its desired effect.",3
I read this at 18. I re-read it 10 years later and was more disturbed by it the second time. ,3
"Gira may not be a writer, but he's imaginative and what he managed to put to paper is some of the most unique and visceral stories I've ever read. I like some of the short stories in the first half very much, but I think the spoken work segments of the second half are the best parts of the book. He's at his best when he's doing nothing but playing with imagery. ",5
"<br />Here is the only Portuguese literary joke I know: Q. Who are the four greatest Portuguese poets of the 20th century? A. Fernando Pessoa. Trust me, it's funny. But it does take a little explaining.<br /><br />Fernando Pessoa, in order to express various philosophical and poetic moods, constructed a series of what he termed “heteronyms.” The heteronym, although similar to the mask or persona, differs in that each one is equipped with a name, a personality, a biography, and a physical description, as well as a distinct writing style. Although Pessoa made use of more than five dozen heteronyms in the course of his thirty-five years, the best known are Alberto Caeiro, Ricardo Reis, Álvaro de Campos, and Bernardo Soares. Of these four, his greatest creation--and perhaps the heteronym closest to Pessoa's self--is Bernardo Soares, the ""author"" of <i>The Book of Disquiet.</i> <br /><br /><i>The Book of Disquiet</i>, if not unique, is close to it. It is a little like a novel, often like a collection of prose poems, and often like a series of aphorisms and philosophical reflections. The heteryonum that is Soares enables Pessoa to communicate a disciplined, definite vision of the world, necessarily limited in scope, but intensified and concentrated. In this sense, it resembles Roman and English satire, its authorial mask as carefully crafted and resonant as those of Horace and Juvenal, Pope and Swift. Soares, however, takes no interest in vice, let alone the reform of humankind; in fact, he seems to care little about humanity in general, or people in particular. <br /><br />It is here that the novelistic aspect of this work becomes interesting. Soares is a shy, isolated man, a clerk at a Lisbon commercial firm who adds up columns of figures, and seems to do little else. Although he mourns his colleagues when they pass away, he never seems to communicate with them when they are alive; the closest he seems to get to fellowship are his encounters with the waiter in the little cafe where he eats his nightly dinner and consumes his nightly bottle of wine. At first, we feel sorry for him, for we feel his great isolation and are moved by his great passion and profound love for beauty which he can only express through his journal. <br /><br />Slowly, however, we begin to see that this isolation is a personal and artistic choice, a way of refining his art and his being . If he cares about human beings at all, it is only because they are useful adjuncts to his own magnificent loneliness, because they resonate as discrete elements of the poet's imagination, much as a certain play of light on a Lisbon street may reflect one particular color of the canvas that is the poet's consciousness. Perhaps this is why the book “The Book of Disquiet” reminds me of most is <i>The Chants of Maldoror</i>, that uncompromising paean to the magnificent isolation of evil.<br /><br />There is of course a great difference. <i>Maldoror</i> could only have been produced by a very young man hiding beneath a very old mask. His persona is a posture of isolation through which he begins to know himself. <i>The Book of Disquiet</i>, on the other hand, is the work of someone who knows himself well, and cares only about reaching a kind of existential purity: a clarity of view, a refinement of mood, the isolation of particular beauties that resonate more deeply and linger longer than the others.<br /><br />Soares is a monk of the poetic mind, for whom aloneness is a vocation. Its fruit, this memorable book, is rare and delicious, filled with vivid descriptions, evocative language, and refined reflections.",5
"Humans are social beings, to the extent that those who prefer solitude to the company of others are usually perceived as troubled individuals, outside of the norm; it took me a <i>long</i> time to feel comfortable with being alone, with dampening the guilt that flared up in me every time I begged off going out with a group of friends. It is always a welcome reinforcement when I come across a book penned by a fellow recluse—and <i>The Book of Disquiet</i> could be a solitary soul's bible, so powerfully does it speak in the language of single-place table settings, corner-chair cobwebs and bachelor apartments. It has achieved pride of place on my bedside stack, where I can ladle myself servings of Pessoa's wisdom at leisure.<br /><br />This book's voluntarily alone author is Fernando Pessoa, a Portuguese poet, writer, and polylinguist who invented fully-fleshed out <i>heteronyms</i>—distinct and separate personalties of differing nationality and gender—in order to pursue his writing in various idiosyncratic shades and styles. <i>The Book of Disquiet</i> is a collection of the aphoristic prose-poetry musings of one such <i>heteronym</i>, that of Bernardo Soares, assembled from notes, entries, and jottings made over a span of some thirty years and left unpublished at the time of Pessoa's death in 1935. Richard Zenith, the editor and translator of this stunning, haunting, and achingly beautiful paean to the imaginary potentiality of man, has compiled the definitive edition of this tome in a truly outstanding translation that captures the expressive eloquence of Pessoa and his magical, metaphorically rich manner of constructing word images to portray his unique way of life.<br /><br />There is no finer encomium to the shattering melancholy and bracing affirmation of loneliness and solitude than the five hundred plus entries that make up <i>The Book of Disquiet</i>; and few better descriptions of existential nausea, of the desperate efforts to perceive a reason to continue with the painful disappointments, shadow terrors, and numbing meaninglessness of human existence. As Pessoa—writing as Soares—quietly and unassumingly goes about his daily rituals of walking, working as a book-keeper and inhabiting the well-trod spaces of his rented room in the real world, he is living a rich existence within the wildly creative contours of his mind: as a knight errant, a rich merchant, a pirate, a voyager, a lover of countless women, a guide to the cosmos, an inhaler of sunrises and embracer of sunsets, the guiding hand of every drop of Lisbon's morning showers, the leaves shaken by a sudden burst of wind. Having been sentenced to a term of life by an errant universe, Pessoa decided to renounce action and ambitions in what we hold to be <i>real</i> life to pursue a variegated and abundant existence within the realm of dreams. As our life is measured through the archived clippings of one's memory, whether one actually <i>performed</i> the deeds recalled matters less than the detail and substance they contain.<br /><br />Such, at least, is the defense offered by Pessoa; yet often his solipsistic persuasions are contradictory, defensive; and when the mask slips we can see the depth of pain and loneliness underneath the placid surface of his imaginary life. There is much repetition and mulling over of themes from different angles, but the writing is so expressive and raw and honest that, to myself at least, it never becomes tedious—even as the <i>tedium</i> of existence, the stretching of the soul on the rack of time, is one of the principal ideas that populate Pessoa's thoughts and entries. It is as if <i>tedium</i> was experienced as a box of chocolates, each colour and coating, each form and flavour, each taste and texture, mulled over, pondered, drawn out and examined, and then set to paper as a running record to remind of an eccentric daily pleasure.<br /><br />This is a book to be mused upon and savored, one that can be imbibed in different ways: it can be read straight through—the way I approached it, drawn into a white heat of blistered enthrallment—or sparingly sampled over weeks, months, even years. The order the aphorisms are assembled in is purely a construction of Zenith; he stresses such in his introduction and encourages each reader to create their own sequence for the collected entries. However the reader decides to approach <i>The Book of Disquiet</i>, they will be rewarded with the inventive honesty of a hale and wounded man from a work that is truly <i>sui generis</i>.<br /><br /> *******************************************************<br /><br />I've recently picked up the <a href=""http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1301935.The_Book_of_Disquiet"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Serpent's Tail Extraordinary Classic</a> edition, which features a translation by Margaret Jull Costa, who performed similar duties for José Saramago's last half-dozen books. Distinct from Zenith, obviously, but just as potent and powerful—and the differently parsed words and sentences only serve to present Pessoa's incomparable poetry of loneliness in a new light, equally fulgent and searing, just focussed from an alternate angle. A richly marbled interiority of immanent pain and transcendent beauty.<br /><br /> *******************************************************<br /><br />Revisiting the disquietude of early modern Lisbon, I'm reminded anew how this collection of Pessoa's dispassionate passion is one whose title is so perfectly matched to the content within that one can sit there (all by oneself, of course) cushioned within the utter silence of an unvoiced existence, serving as an unexciting urban renewal zone for migratory dust motes and unimpressive highland anchored lethality for predatory silken arachnids, with a nigh sardonic set to the tight-lipped, hesitantly-committed smile of satisfaction that imprints itself upon one's otherwise stoney visage, and marvel at how much one man's textually decanted imaginative impressions and gossamer ruminations running the interior gauntlet of unlived memories, unacted performances, unconsummated affairs, unshed tears, unwatched observations, unwinged flights, ungrounded fears, unfelt kisses, untouched caresses, uninvolved emotions, unexercised exertions, untasted repasts, unliked friendships, unmet acquaintances, untold stories, unpoured libations, undone happenings, unannounced recollections, unlit umbrages, unformed expressions, untraveled journeys, unnoticeable leavenings, unhoused guilts, and unarticulated speechifications resonate, to the fullest extent, with the plucked strings ever aquiver within the utterly empty, lonely, and withdrawn chambers of the mind- and/or house-bound soul.",5
"If you read this, you need to know what you are signing up for, so, below, I’ll let Pessoa speak for himself. It’s a series of vignettes, random thoughts and meditations all written between 1913 and 1935. <br><br><img src=""https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1555792277i/27390794._SX540_.jpg"" width=""363"" height=""242"" alt=""description"" class=""gr-hostedUserImg"" loading=""lazy""><br><br>It’s a work of genius, of course. Pessoa, the famous Portuguese writer and poet was known for his multiple writing personalities (heteronyms). Disquiet was supposedly written by Bernardo Soares, an excruciatingly lonely and socially dysfunctional man. He’s a shipping clerk at a textile wholesaling firm and spends his entire life a few blocks from his tiny apartment with one window on a balcony. He goes to the same restaurant, same tobacconist and same barber for thirty years. All of them die one by one in their 70s, which he only discovers by going into their shop and finding out they died the day before. The first two passages below show some of his severe social issues. <br><br>“Moreover, I am bothered by the idea of being forced into contact with someone. A simple invitation to dine with a friend provokes in me an anguish it would be hard to define. The idea of any social obligation – going to a funeral, discussing an office matter face-to-face with someone, going to the station to wait for someone I know or don’t know - the mere idea disturbs a whole day’s thoughts. Sometimes I am concerned all through the night and sleep badly. And the real thing, when it happens, is absolutely insignificant, justifying nothing; and the thing repeats itself and I don’t ever learn to learn.” <br><br>“Sometimes saying hello to someone intimidates me. My voice dries up, as if there were a strange audacity in having to say that word out loud.” <br><br><img src=""https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1555792277i/27390795._SX540_.jpg"" width=""363"" height=""242"" alt=""description"" class=""gr-hostedUserImg"" loading=""lazy""><br><br>“There are metaphors that are more real than the people walking down the street. There are images in the secret corners of books that live more clearly than many men and women. There are literary phrases that possess an absolutely human individuality. There are passages in paragraphs of mine that chill me with fear, so clearly do I feel them to be people, standing alone so freely from the walls of my room, at night, in shadows…”<br> <br>“Yes, dreaming that I am, for example, simultaneously, separately, unconfusedly, a man and a woman taking a walk along a riverbank, To see myself, at the same time, with equal clarity, in the same way, with no mixing, being the two things, integrated equally in both, a conscious boat in a southern sea and a printed page in an ancient book. How absurd this seems! But everything is absurd, and this dream is the least of the absurdities.” <br><br>“There is nothing that reveals poverty of mind more quickly than not knowing how to be witty except at the expense of others.” <br><br>“I go forward slowly, dead, and my vision is no longer mine, it’s nothing: it’s only the vision of the human animal who, without wanting, inherited Greek culture, Roman order, Christin morality, and all the other illusions that constitute the civilization in which I feel.” <br><br>“In the dark depth of my soul, invisible, unknown forces were locked in a battle in which my being was the battleground, and all of me trembled because of the unknown struggle. A physical nausea at all of life was born when I awakened. A horror at having to live rose up with me from the bed. Everything seemed empty, and I had the cold impression that there is no solution for any problem.” <br><br>“Ennui is not the illness of the boredom of not having anything to do, but the more serious illness of feeling that it’s not worthwhile doing anything. And being that way, the more there is to do, the more ennui there is to feel.” <br><br>“How many times, how many, as now, has it pained me to feel what I am feeling – to feel something like anguish only because that’s what feeling is, the disquiet of being here, the nostalgia for something else, something unknown, the sunset of all emotions, the yellowing of myself fading into ashy sadness in my external awareness of myself.” <br><br>“During certain very clear moments of meditation, like these in which, at the beginning of the afternoon, I wander observingly through the streets, every person brings me a message, every house shows me something new, every sign has an announcement for me.” <br><br>“Sometimes, with a sad delight, I think that if some day, in a future to which I may not belong, these words I’m writing will endure and receive praise, I will finally have people who ‘understand’ me, my people, the true family to be born into and to be loved by. But far from being born into it, I will have already died a long time before. I will be understood only in effigy, when affection no longer compensates the dead person for the disaffection he experienced when alive.” <br><br><img src=""https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1555792277i/27390796._SX540_.jpg"" width=""363"" height=""242"" alt=""description"" class=""gr-hostedUserImg"" loading=""lazy""><br><br>“I consider life an inn where I have to stop over until the coach from the abyss arrives. I don’t know where it will take me because I don’t know anything. I could consider this inn a prison because I’m force to stay inside it; I could consider it a place for socializing because I meet others here…I slowly sing, only to myself, songs that I compose as I wait.” <br><br>“Everything is emptier than the void….If I think this and look around to see if reality is killing me with thirst, I see inexpressive houses, inexpressive faces, inexpressive gestures. Stone, bodies, ideas – everything’s dead. All movements are stopping points, all of them the same stopping point. Nothing says anything to me. Nothing is familiar to me, not because I find it strange but because I don’t know what it is. The world is lost. And in the depth of my soul – the only reality at this moment – there is an intense, invisible anguish, a sadness, like the sound of someone weeping in a dark room.” <br><br>Not an easy or a pleasant read, but genius. <br><br>Top painting from <a target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" href=""http://i2.wp.com/www.revistabula.com"">i2.wp.com/www.revistabula.com</a><br>Sculpture of Pessoa in Lisbon from alamy.com<br>Photo of Lisbon in 1940 from atlaslisboa.com<br><br>[Edited 8/24/23]",5
"<i>The Book of Disquiet</i> is incredibly aphoristic – one can take almost any sentence at random and use it as an aphorism…<br /><blockquote>And so, not knowing how to believe in God and unable to believe in an aggregate of animals, I, along with other people on the fringe, kept a distance from things, a distance commonly called Decadence. Decadence is the total loss of unconsciousness, which is the very basis of life.</blockquote><br /><i>The Book of Disquiet</i> is an anthem to the futility of life and a hymn of life’s preciousness.<br /><blockquote>And so we were left, each man to himself, in the desolation of feeling ourselves live. A ship may seem to be an object whose purpose is to sail, but no, its purpose is to reach a port. We found ourselves sailing without any idea of what port we were supposed to reach. Thus we reproduced a painful version of the Argonauts’ adventurous precept: living doesn’t matter, only sailing does.</blockquote><br />And <b>Fernando Pessoa</b> fearlessly proceeds right from the point where Ecclesiastes stopped…<br />“I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and, behold, all <i>is</i> vanity and vexation of spirit…” <i>Ecclesiastes 1:14</i><br /><blockquote>To recognize reality as a form of illusion and illusion as a form of reality is equally necessary and equally useless…</blockquote><br />And so we keep moving through our reality and through our illusions until our “dust returns to the earth as it was…”",5
"I have this habit of keeping a pencil close by when I'm reading a book which I know is going to have some passages I want to remember. So, whenever I come across a sentence or a paragraph that strikes me for some reason, I underline it.<br />Well now, what's mostly happened with my copy of the ""The book of disquiet"" by Fernando Pessoa is that there is something underlined in almost every page of the book. Which is the same to say that this is a memorable book on the whole. I'd even dare to say that this is more than a mere book, it is a gate to upper thinking, a new way of understanding the world, a new philosophy, a daring and maybe even scary but sincere approach to what is hidden in our human souls, if we are brave enough to look.<br /><br /><br />I knew a bit of Pessoa before I picked up this book. Vastly known Portuguese poet, famous for his ability to create different ""personalities"" and stick to them closely to perfection, writing in different styles according to the voice of each character. Schizophrenia? Or the mind of a genius who fooled everyone who knew him? Or a man who disguised himself out of boredom and who was able to live more than 70 different and complete lives through all these invented ""characters"" to become a complete real person? Maybe all these options at once. Maybe none. We'll never know.<br />Anyway, even though I knew about Pessoa, I wasn't prepared for this book. <br />Not only unconnected recollections of the ""supposed"" life of Bernardo Soares, one of Pessoa's characters, but also unanswerable questions which left me kind of anxious and peaceful at the same time, if that makes any sense...<br />Questions regarding consciousness, the almost obsession about dreams and the state of peaceful lethargy of sleeping, doubts aroused regarding deities, love and death. And about what it is to be happy or to feel nostalgia about a non existent past, or about egoism and solitude. But all this questions made even more intense with this overflowing passion for writing, and for literature. And for Lisbon. <br /><br /><br />A privileged mind which opens for us, humble readers who want to witness an amazing transformation of the world surrounding us, seeing for the first time what our lives really are, or what they aren't and what we should expect them to be.<br />An experience which will leave you exhausted but with renewed energy to face this extenuating and unavoidable journey which we call life.",5
"There you go, friend, you’re ambling amiably across the vast antiseptically postmodern, socially distanced, desolate landscape of Pessoa...<br /><br />And peaceably enough ensconced in your own little zeitgeist, so much so that you don’t notice he’s got a heavy bludgeoning blackjack poised above your skull...<br /><br />With your name on it. <br /><br />And you see, don’t you, that he’s going to clobber you with that steel blackjack, conk you out and deep-six you?

"<b>1</b><br><br>Some books wrap me up in dreams and fantasy, creating a protective bubble in which I can leisurely gaze at the world in comfort. The opposite happened when reading “The Book of Disquiet”, a book that lives up to its title like no other. I didn’t get wrapped up in anything. With every sentence I read I felt myself being unwrapped, as layers of self-deceit and unconsciousness were shed. <br><br><b>2</b><br><br>I held the book in my hands. I could decide to open and close it. I could decide to put it away. But despite all that it didn’t take long for me to realise that I was not the one in power, as the book firmly grasped me in turn. Not through my mind, like good books. Not through my heart, like great books. It grasped my soul and never let go. While I was reading this book, I couldn’t shake the feeling that it had beaten me to it, in that the book was reading me and that it did so more quickly and effectively than I could read its pages. This book is a mirror for my soul, a mirror in which my reflection always sees me first, a mirror where my reflection waves to me and I wave back.<br> <br><b>3</b><br><br>I’m compelled to take over the book’s structure in this review, and that’s not only because of <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1296410248?book_show_action=false&amp;from_review_page=1"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Junta’s shining example</a>. There is no plot weaving together the pages. The book is made up of more than two hundred diary entries. But this is a special diary. The entries seldom talk of work, of interactions with other people, of the goings-on in the day. They deal with the author’s rich inner life, to which the outside reality offers only a background at best. Pessoa sat down at his desk and just wrote what he thought. Streams of thoughts are often fragmentary, and so is this book. Every number allows a new idea to carry you through poetic landscapes until the author reaches the shores of that idea and he starts over, sometimes with a new idea, sometimes with the same, sometimes leading to the same shore, sometimes further away or closer by. As a result, my notes of my reactions to the book are equally fragmentary, each note representing a new stream as I glide to the next number and I start over.<br> <br><b>4</b><br><br>One of my favorite things to do is to stand in between two mirrors that stand directly opposite of each other. To see my reflection multiplied to infinity is the most humbling ego-boost I can think of. I say infinity but if you look far enough into that world of infinite reflections there is a dark hole at the end of it, there where the light ceases to reach and where my beholding eye ceases to behold. <br>Consciousness is a mirror. Consciousness of consciousness leads to a similar infinity that seemingly leads to nothingness. <br><br><b>5</b><br><br>Infinity sharpens my mind and elates my heart as a concept, but it numbs my mind and shrinks my heart as a reality. Nothingness is just one version of infinity. Equating everything to zero is the easiest solution to find, but the most difficult one to accept. <br><br><b>6</b><br><br>I don’t know if this book has changed my life. It added a layer of consciousness to my consciousness and makes me more aware of inner processes. On the other hand, it couldn’t have done so if it didn’t confirm my consciousness, if it didn’t confirm what I already felt and knew without knowing. My soul was stripped of the comfort and warmth of the mundane, but already I feel myself slipping back into the world and out of myself. <br><br><b>7</b><br><br>A connection feels meaningful when it is direct, goes deep and is complete.<br> <br><b>8</b><br><br>Dreams I’ve never bothered to write down, thoughts and follies that were interrupted: much of what I have said, written and thought is lost. Only the abstract memory of having said, written and thought lingers. Before I go to sleep, thoughts wash over me, turning around in my head, taking five paths at once and dancing in harmony. The mind is cleared and cleansed with these high-speed thought-cycles but then, a jolt of consciousness, the spell is broken and the thoughts are forever lost, hiding away in dreams. The heavy weight of consciousness doesn’t last as another torrent of thoughts sweeps down and I fall into a peaceful sleep. How I would like to commit those thoughts to paper, to catch the wild torrents and be at peace.<br> <br><b>9</b><br><br>In my mind’s eye a castle is easily conjured up, the atmosphere is palpable, the potential for storytelling enormous. I pick up my pen. The jester is no longer a concept, but a living thing in need of adventures and adjectives. The scene becomes heavy and slow and I grind to a halt. <br><br><b>10</b><br><br>An unlikable side-effect of my consciousness is that I can’t help but feel special. That feeling doesn’t start at the cerebral level. Somewhere in the depths of my diaphragm there is this core, a source of that intuition. Sometimes that core is cold and the feeling fades, but this book made it burn brightly. I look at the reviews page and I see that it did so for others. My feeling special makes way for a special feeling. <br><br><b>11</b><br><br>Like Pessoa, I find a lot of philosophy in the exceedingly small. That which does not matter, matters precisely because of it. When I look at an ant hard at work, I find that its essence is its being. This goes for everything, but it is in the insignficant that this is made the most obvious to me. A blade of grass sticking out of the pavement. Small numbers written in pencil on a wall that now have lost all significance. A bug. An abandoned shack that has fallen in disuse. <br><br>I was hiking in a wild, rough coastal region in France. On the sandy path there was a small patch of pebbles and I resolved to pick one up and throw it into the sea far below when I'd get close enough. During my walk I thought about what had brought the pebble to that patch, what had brought me there, and as ever, one thought led to the other. The pebble became heavy with my ponderings. I could not bring myself to throw it into the anonymity of the crashing waves when the time came. <br><br><b>12</b><br><br><img src=""https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1489598699i/22230868._SY540_.png"" class=""gr-hostedUserImg"" loading=""lazy""> <br> <br><b>13</b><br><br>Whenever I find wonder in the banal, nothingness becomes less likely.

</i><br /><b>Almost all my feelings…</b><br />As soon as I turned the last page, I realized how much I was going to miss <a href=""https://goodreads.com/book/show/45974.The_Book_of_Disquiet"" title=""The Book of Disquiet by Fernando Pessoa"" rel=""noopener"">The Book of Disquiet</a>. For it has been my faithful companion for over two weeks, as my friends are witness for their company was always there with me. As soon as I turned the last page, I worried, what am I going to do now? But now it seems my only consolation is all the quotes I collected during this lavish period. So I now populate my new solitude with these gems, with <a href=""https://goodreads.com/author/show/7816.Fernando_Pessoa"" title=""Fernando Pessoa"" rel=""noopener"">Fernando Pessoa</a>’s amazing dreams.<br /><i>
  <blockquote>'I've never done anything but dream. This, and this alone, has been the meaning of my life. My only real concern has been my inner life. My worst sorrows have evaporated when I've opened the window on the street of my dreams and forgotten myself in what I saw there.'</blockquote>
</i><br />I’ve always been a dreamer, but I dream mainly through readings that I always carried along with me in my life’s journey. I cannot now pretend to be a dreamer like Fernando Pessoa, or Bernardo Soare: <i>I’ve never done anything but dream. This, and this alone, has been the meaning of my life.</i> For I lived more in the real world than Pessoa confessedly did. <i>Every dream is the same dream, for they're all dreams. Let God change my dreams, but for my gift of dreaming.</i> For him they were his nourishment, his own life. But for me they are my leisure. Yes, my dreams might not be his dreams but they are as alive as his, as dear to me as his were to him.<br /><i>
  <blockquote>'I read and I am liberated. I acquire objectivity. I cease being myself and so scattered. And what I read, instead of being like a nearly invisible suit that sometimes oppresses me, is the external world’s tremendous and remarkable clarity, the sun that sees everyone, the moon that splotches the still earth with shadows, the wide expanses that end in the sea, the blackly solid trees whose tops greenly wave, the steady peace of ponds of farms, the terraced slopes with their paths overgrown with grape-vines.'</blockquote>
</i><br />We might be distinct souls, but there is one thing that we are one and that I felt is his anxiety and is also my own:<br /><i>
  <blockquote>'My tedium takes on an air of horror, and my boredom is a fear. My sweat isn’t cold, but my awareness of it is. I’m not physically ill, but my soul’s anxiety is so intense that it passes through my pores and chills my body.'</blockquote>
</i><br />Yes, it seems we could even be related, <br /><i>
  <blockquote>'It sometimes occurs to me, with sad delight, that if one day (...) the sentences I write are read and admired, then at last I'll have my own kin, people who 'understand' me, my true family in which to be born and loved.'</blockquote>
</i><br />The main difference is that I am not a writer, I am only a reader. And so I am his soul mate for I complete him when I leaf through the pages of his book. As are all his readers that give life to his writings. His prose so beautiful it is heartbreaking, despite his own insecurities. But I would I wish to be a writer if the price is to not live? <i>Better to write to dare to live...</i><br /><br />Do you suppose that that is the reason of my contentment? <i>Should you ask if I’m happy, I’ll say that I’m not.</i> For me there is not so much solitude, no lack of friendship, no ceaseless tedium. <i>Only unhappiness is elevating, and only the tedium that comes from unhappiness is heraldic like the descendants of ancient heroes.</i> So, I could not ever be a good poet and I am glad I had never desired so high. Although I have to confess that I had some dreams of being a poet. But these were only dreams… <br /><br />Perhaps I could have never been a poet, for above all I love. I love my friends, I love my children, I loved a man and I love life. And I could never declare like Pessoa, <i>We never love anyone. What we love is the idea we have of someone. It’s our concept – our own selves – that we love.</i> Or even that <i>[l]ife hinders the expression of life. If I actually lived a great love, I would never be able to describe it.</i> Maye I should read other poets… But I have to agree with him when he states, <i>I wake up to make sure I exist...</i> Aren’t we all always unsure if we truly exist?<br /><br />Am I ordinary?, for most of the time I realize I think with my feelings. While Pessoa confesses: <i>I believe most people think with their feelings, whereas I feel with my thoughts. </i> Yes, I am happily ordinary. While his <i>happiness is as painful as [his] pain.</i><br /><br />However, the more I say I don’t agree with our poet, the more I believe him. Am I saying nonsense? Sometimes to be a poet is to unbelieve. Oh, I believe we can travel through our dreams, we can imagine unimaginable places within our dreams:<br /><i>
  <blockquote>'What can China give me that my soul hasn't already given me? And if my soul can't give it to me, how will China give it to me? For it's with my soul that I'll see China, if I ever see it. I could go and seek riches in the Orient, but not the riches of the soul, because I am my soul's riches, and I am where I am, with or without the Orient.'</blockquote>
</i><br />But after all my <i>incoherence</i>, I can only agree with Pessoa:<br /><i>
  <blockquote>'It's the central error of the literary imagination: to suppose that others are like us and must feel as we do. Fortunately for humanity, each man is just who he is, it begin given only to the genius to be others as well.'</blockquote>
</i>.<br />But our natures are diverse, for I am not as solitary as he was. I am solitary, you might say, but I have my books. What does he have? Only his dreams or a poignant and fruitful solitude. <i>To understand, I destroyed myself. To understand is to forget about loving.</i> Can we be that alone? I ask myself, or only genius and poets have that gift? Perhaps, if so that is a sad truth.<br /><br /><b>Some closing remarks…</b><br />I feel I need to add a few considerations, besides my ramblings above.<br /><br />Pessoa called this work as a <i>factless biography</i>. It might present distinct tones of the absurd, and despite its hints of indifference or even cynicism, it’s nevertheless a quintessential trait of its writer. He reveals an ethereal existence, or his own life, through his willful approach towards his own disquietude; through his sense of a consciousness that suffers with a tedium that results basically from his own senselessness existence. And in that he could not be more truthful.<br /><br />Faced with the life’s adversity, and aiming to overcome the anguish to him so acute, he imagines, he dreams. This may be one of the reasons for his so many personalities (his heteronyms, who could each write in distinct literary styles) to be born. He is not one, he is many. So he can experience different lives in only one existence. According to him:<br /><i>
  <blockquote>'My intellect has attained a pliancy and a reach that enable me to assume any emotion I desire and enter at will into any state of mind.'</blockquote>
</i><br />For me, his flow of thoughts or dreaming that we read in <i>The Book of Disquiet</i> captures the writer’s mind, reveals a structure and a repetition in thoughts that talks about solitude, dream, tedium, love or <i>un-love</i> and unhappiness. It is ultimately passionate and painful.<br /><br />Bernardo Soares is Pessoa’s heteronym considered to be the closest to Pessoa’s real self; and his writings strongly express Pessoa’s aspiration to live an imagined life, as if in a dream, so as to forget his self in real life. He continually writes about his dreams, their nature and importance to his survival:<br /><i>
  <blockquote>'Live your life. Don’t be lived by it. Right or wrong, happy or sad, be your own self. You can do this only by dreaming, because your real life, your human life, is the one that doesn’t belong to you but to others. You must replace your life with your dreaming, concentrating only on dreaming perfectly. In all the acts of your real life, from that of being born to that of dying, you don’t act – you’re acted; you don’t live – you’re merely lived.'</blockquote>
</i><br /><i>Rain</i> frequently appear in his writings and it could be viewed as a symbol of his disquietude, his unrelenting dreaming that pours over his own existence. What a wistful and beautiful vision Pessoa gifts us:<br /><i>
  <blockquote>“Each drop of rain is my failed life weeping in nature. There’s something of my disquiet in the endless drizzle, then shower, then drizzle, then shower, through which the day’s sorrow uselessly pours itself out over the earth. It rains and keeps raining. My soul is damp from hearing it. So much rain… My flesh is watery around my physical sensation of it.</blockquote>
</i><br />And he dialogues with the readers, but mainly he questions or even doubts himself and his own writing:<br /><i>
  <blockquote>'What will I be ten years from now, or even five? My friends say I'll be one of the greatest contemporary poets - they say this based on what I've written, not what I may yet write. But even if this is true, I have no idea what it will mean. I have no idea how it will taste. Perhaps glory tastes like death and futility, and triumph smells of rottenness.'</blockquote>
</i><br />The Book of Disquiet moved and overwhelmed me fiercely. Pessoa bit by bit immersed himself into my own self, made me wonder and tremble with his alluring and poignant words, much above a mere understanding. I perceived his disquiet, and I shared with him many uncertainties or yet his certainties. His solitude and his dreaming are written down in my soul and will certainly come back to me in the future. Ah, to be such a poet, what a dream and what sufferings! <br /><br /><b>___<br />Other quotes</b><br /><br /><b>•</b> <i>'I weep over my imperfect pages, but if future generations read them, they will be more touched by my weeping than by any imperfection I might have achieved, since perfection would have kept me from weeping and, therefore, from writing.

"Job: “My soul is weary of my life.”<br /><br />Pessoa/Soares: “I'd woken up early, and I took a long time getting ready to exist.” <br /><br />Pessoa/Soares: “I write because I don’t know.”<br /><br />You are planning a party; here’s your guest list:<br /><br />Dostoevsky’s Raskolnikov (from Crime and Punishment)<br />Melville’s “Bartelby the Scrivener”<br />Kafka’s Gregor Samsa (from The Metamorphosis) <br />Joyce’s Stephan Dedalus (from The Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man)<br />Camus’s Merseault (from The Stranger)<br />Beckett’s Molloy<br />Sartre’s Roquentin (from Nausea)<br /><br />I'm a comics guy, too, so let's let in Noah Van Sciver (who wrote Disquiet [I suspect naming it with Pessoa in mind] and a comics biography, The Hypo: The Melancholic Young Lincoln)<br /><br />Hmm, maybe you also invite Hamlet (for some historical perspective) to recite his “To be or not to be. . . “ soliloquy as entertainment, or have Macbeth say out his speech at the party opening, “Tomorrow and tomorrow creeps in this petty pace from day to day. . .”<br /><br />And you will add your own literary grumps, when you begin to pick up the pattern of this literary party guest list. Some fun, eh? What’s a good party game for this bunch, Russian Roulette? My list above is all male, but I also just read (8/21) Anna Kavan's Asylum Piece, so I could make another list of just women, too, of course.<br /><br />I just met someone who is a perfect addition to the guest list, Bernardo Soares, from Ferdinand Pessoa’s Book of Disquiet published in 1982, 47 years after his death at 47 in 1935. What do they have in common, the characters on our guest list? All men, yep. Men largely living without women. And many of them alone, even if they live with others. Sad, sad men. Melancholic. Intense. Maybe today we would psychologically diagnose some of them as bipolar or neurologically diagnose them as autistic/Asperger Syndrome or philosophically diagnose them as nihilist?<br /><br />So what does Soares, a mild assistant bookkeeper, bring to the party that we don’t already have? Well, for one, he’s Portuguese, from Lisbon, and The Rua dos Douradores, where he lives and works and eats alone in one solitary restaurant night after night. Soares’s “story”—never to be finished, based on scraps of paper Pessoa threw in a trunk, edited and arranged by Richard Zenith with loving care—is mainly a collection of aphorisms and philosophical reflections and psychological insights with respect to Soares’s experience of “disquiet,” which I take to be a psychological condition akin to depression, ennui, and alienation, but which also seems to be a kind of existentialist statement. <br /><br />Some people think Pessoa’s Book of Disquiet makes of Lisbon what Joyce’s works make of Dublin, or Kafka’s works make of Prague. The difference? Joyce’s novel is a narrative, and Disquiet actually resists narrative in most respects. It resists coherence, completion, and is a kind of deconstructionist, meta-fictional precursor to postmodernism. Resistant to logic. Often absurd. I don’t think it is for everyone, especially if you want to read a good old-fashioned story, but it does create a portrait of an interesting character, and it does have some of the most beautiful and insightful sentences you will ever read in a book. Many people list it as one of the greatest works of fiction of all time, and I won’t say nay to that, but I think as he never finished it, most readers won’t finish it, either. Would Pessoa care if we finished it? What does it mean to ""finish"" or not finish any book, especially this one? <br /><br />The basic move Pessoa makes to convey “disquiet” is a set of repeated paralyzing contradictions, inversions, circularities or oxymorons, which can also seem very darkly funny:<br /><br /> “. . . the stoicism of the weak.”<br /><br />“Though naturally ambitious, he savored the pleasure of having no ambitions at all.”<br /><br />“Consoler of the inconsolable, Tears of those who never cry, Hour that never sounds — free me from joy and happiness.”<br /><br />“To give love is to lose love.”<br /><br />“Only unhappiness raises us up.”<br /><br />“My joy is as painful as my grief.”<br /><br />“Since we can't extract beauty from life, let's at least try to extract beauty from not being able to extract beauty from life.”<br /><br />And on and on, delightfully and sometimes painfully so.<br /><br />The Book of Soares’s Disquiet is a portrait of melancholy, of isolation:<br /><br />“I am not a pessimist, I am merely sad.”<br /><br />“I aspire to nothing. Life wounds me.”<br /><br />“Do not make the infantile mistake of asking the meaning of things and words. Nothing has any meaning.”<br /><br />“. . . the chance circumstances of his life and the direction it had taken were dictated by his instincts, in his case inertia and detachment.”<br /><br />“My past is everything I failed to be.” <br /><br />“I feel as if I'm always on the verge of waking up.” <br /><br />“I'm sick of everything, and of the everythingness of everything.”<br /> <br />“I've always rejected being understood. To be understood is to prostitute oneself. I prefer to be taken seriously for what I'm not, remaining humanly unknown, with naturalness and all due respect.” <br /> <br />“. . . the stagnant jewel of my ecstatic disdain.”<br /><br />Soares in his spare time keeps a journal of sorts, though we have no idea when he wrote what he wrote. Writing and reading do sustain him, in a way. <br /><br />“There are metaphors more real than the people who walk in the street. There are images tucked away in books that live more vividly than many men and women. There are phrases from literary works that have a positively human personality.”<br /><br />But writing is also not self-discovery so much as it is self-erasure:<br /><br />“To write is to forget. Literature is the most agreeable way of ignoring life.” <br /><br />“I write because I don’t know.” {but not that he now expects to know; see above where life has no meaning to discover]<br /><br />And he’s also sustained by dreaming (which is of course related to reading and writing):<br /><br />“I never tried to be anything other than a dreamer. I never paid any attention to people who told me to go out and live. I belonged always to whatever was far from me and to whatever I could never be. Anything that was not mine, however base, always seemed to be full of poetry.”<br /><br />“I've never done anything but dream. This, and this alone, has been the meaning of my life. My only real concern has been my inner life.”<br /><br />But as with writing, there's also the flip side of dreaming:<br /><br />“The only important fact for me is the fact that I exist and that I suffer and cannot entirely dream myself out of feeling that suffering.”<br /><br />“Their way of dreaming is a garment that conceals, not a dream that creates.”<br /><br />And he's alone:<br /><br />“We never love anyone. What we love is the idea we have of someone. It's our own concept—our own selves—that we love.”<br /><br />I want to share a longer section, just so you can get a better feel of Soares:<br /><br />“Today, suddenly, I reached an absurd but unerring conclusion. In a moment of enlightenment, I realized that I'm nobody, absolutely nobody. When the lightning flashed, I saw that what I had thought to be a city was in fact a deserted plain and, in the same sinister light that revealed me to myself, there seemed to be no sky above it. I was robbed of any possibility of having existed before the world. If I was ever reincarnated, I must have done so without myself, without a self to reincarnate.<br /><br />I am the outskirts of some non-existent town, the long-winded prologue to an unwritten book. I'm nobody, nobody. I don't know how to feel or think or love. I'm a character in a novel as yet unwritten, hovering in the air and undone before I've even existed, amongst the dreams of someone who never quite managed to breathe life into me.<br /><br />I'm always thinking, always feeling, but my thoughts lack all reason, my emotions all feeling. I'm falling through a trapdoor, through infinite, infinitous space, in a directionless, empty fall. My soul is a black maelstrom, a great madness spinning about a vacuum, the swirling of a vast ocean around a hole in the void, and in the waters, more like whirlwinds than waters, float images of all I ever saw or heard in the world: houses, faces, books, boxes, snatches of music and fragments of voices, all caught up in a sinister, bottomless whirlpool.”<br /><br />We are left with this explosion of dolorous language, “those feelings that inhabit the gloom of my wearinesses and the grottoes of my disquiets.”<br /><br />The Book of Disquiet raises questions about the nature of authorship in that, while it is technically authored by Pessoa, it is credited to one of his several heteronyms, Bernardo Soares, assistant bookkeeper. Who is Pessoa? He’s not a stable, unified person, but multiple and fractured. Pessoa was known primarily as a poet with several titles under several different names. The whole idea most of ascribe to of an author's ""voice"" is clearly undermined by Pessoa. He leaves us with fragments of literature and identity. <br /><br />As Soares says, I feel “The vast indifference of the stars.” Seems like he and Hamlet and Beckett and Camus would have a lot not to talk about at your party.",5
" <b>""I follow the course of my dreams, making them images into steps toward other images; folding casual metaphors like fans into grand pictures of interior vision; I untie life from myself, and I toss it aside as if it were a too-tight suit.""</b>- Fernando Pessoa, The Book of Disquiet<br /><br />You know a writer is great when he makes you want to learn a new language to understand his work in the original. ""The Book of Disquiet"" is easily the best book I've read this year, and possibly the one I've copied the most quotes from. I'd only ever read Pessoa's poetry and I had no idea what to expect from his prose. It turns out he does poetry and prose equally well.<br /><br />I would love to have a conversation with Pessoa, although I would probably be an annoyance to him with his desire for solitude. But having a deep, philosophical conversation with him would be like a dream. He has such fascinating thoughts! He delves into the complexity of humans and helped me to understand the reason for his several heteronyms in his poetry: <br /><br /><b>""Each of us is various, many people, a prolixity of selves."" </b> <br /><br />I feel that this is the sort of book that people will either think is brilliant or they will think Pessoa is too sentimental and sensitive. I have to say that I rarely come across a writer who thinks so deeply and obsessively about certain things. Pessoa's favourite topics seem to be dreams, solitude, writing, the futility of life (was he an existentialist? He reminds me a bit of Meursault). I may share Pessoa's melancholy to some extent but I don't share his negative outlook, his depression and his misanthropic nature! Even so, this was a brilliant book and one I'm so glad I finally read.<br /><br />Pessoa's writing really consumed me at times. Definitely a book to be savoured, and a candidate for a re-read.<br /><br /> <b>""When I write, I visit myself solemnly. I have special rooms, remembered by someone else in the interstices of my self-representation, where I take pleasure in analyzing what I do not feel, and I examine myself as if I were a painting in the shadows."" </b><br />",5

"<blockquote><i>If I write what I feel, it’s to reduce the fever of feeling. What I confess is unimportant, because everything is unimportant. I make landscapes out of what I feel. I make holidays of my sensations.</i> (42)<br /><br /><i>He who does not know how to populate his solitude, does not know either how to be alone in a busy crowd.</i><br />- Charles Baudelaire, <i>Crowds</i></blockquote><br />Some dreams want to transcend our minds. They want to feel alive, be outside and become reality. We all have dreamed about things that, even after we woke up, we are not sure if they actually happened or never left the secure yet claustrophobic mind of ours. And so, while those dreams are trying to abandon that place, magic can happen. When they realize they can't, tragedy awaits. <br />This is the story of a man who lived a thousand lives and wrote about the fragile boundary between reality and dreaming with the most beautiful and heartbreaking prose I've ever encountered.<br /><br />I wanted to read this book for a long time. When I found it, I did something I try not to do: I skimmed it. I wanted to see something before my better judgment had control over my literary anxiety. Before I knew, I found myself reading a mesmerizing passage that I couldn't leave until I finished it.<br /><blockquote>Lucid Diary<br />My life: a tragedy booed off stage by the gods, never getting beyond the first act.<br />Friends: not one. Just a few acquaintances who imagine they feel something for me and who might be sorry if a train ran over me and the funeral was on a rainy day. The logical reward of my detachment from life is the incapacity I’ve created in others to feel anything for me. There’s an aureole of indifference, an icy halo, that surrounds me and repels others. I still haven’t succeeded in not suffering from my solitude. It’s hard to achieve that distinction of spirit whereby isolation becomes a repose without anguish... (579)</blockquote><br />From that moment, I just knew it was going to be an extremely emotional experience. Whoever said that reading is a passive activity, never found a book with the power of taking his soul out for a ride.<br />What a book. I could relate to almost every word. Every yearning for something that could never happen. Every loss that did happen. Every thought made by a restless mind. And every feeling conceived by an isolated heart longing for an endless dream. A cure. Redemption. Or nothing.<br /><br />The melancholic beauty of his prose and the heartbreaking honesty of his sorrow made me feel too small. And relieved. Suddenly, many of my thoughts and feelings were exposed in those pages that I was never able to write. And he did it. Pessoa did it with the most exquisite language you could ever hope to find. <br /><br />The atmosphere is filled with an overwhelming sense of failure and frustration.<br /><blockquote>I envy – but I’m not sure that I envy – those for whom a biography could be written, or who could write their own. In these random impressions, and with no desire to be other than random, I indifferently narrate my factless autobiography, my lifeless history. These are my Confessions, and if in them I say nothing, it’s because I have nothing to say. (42)<br /><br />Each drop of rain is my failed life weeping in nature. There’s something of my disquiet in the endless drizzle, then shower, then drizzle, then shower, through which the day’s sorrow uselessly pours itself out over the earth.<br />It rains and keeps raining. My soul is damp from hearing it. So much rain... (177)</blockquote><br />Solitude. <br /><blockquote>Solitude devastates me; company oppresses me. (80)<br /><br />Again, fluid and uncertain, the rain pattered. Time dragged to its accompaniment. My soul’s solitude grew and spread, invading what I felt, what I wanted, and what I was going to dream. The room’s hazy objects, which shared my insomnia in the shadows, moved with their sadness into my desolation.

Could it think, the heart would stop beating. (30)<br /><br />I've never had anyone I could call ‘Master’. No Christ died for me. No Buddha showed me the way. No Apollo or Athena, in my loftiest dreams, ever appeared to enlighten my soul. (533)</blockquote><br />And many other displays of human nature. Devastating situations that contrast themselves with the lyrical beauty of this man's writing.<br />His crude words are still little sunbeams that could enlighten the obscure depths of our souls, only if we let them. In that so human selfishness of ours, we always think nobody is suffering more than we do. We are the only ones struggling to survive in this world that we never asked for. Well, we are not; that is not an extraordinary epiphany. But reading the words of a man whose thoughts are so familiar to us always represents an inspirational experience. We feel like we just found the necessary balm to soothe our pain. That is the healing power of understanding. Of empathy. <br />We are not alone. We never were. Like Soares in this book, I am acquainted with isolation more than I would have wanted to. I breathe it. I am made of it. And still, somehow, I am not alone. <br /><blockquote>A breath of music or of a dream, of something that would make me almost feel, something that would make me not think. (57)</blockquote><br />Being fatally sensitive can be exhausting and a perpetual cause of sorrow. But the so-desired inability to feel resembles to being dead inside a living body. Human existence doesn't limit itself to some functional organs. Feeling nothing is not the answer. You might as well be truly dead.<br /><br />So, yes. This book is my newest treasure. My diary and sanctuary. I can't help but to be grateful. It filled my head with many questions that I wish I could find the answers by myself.<br />What to do when we are forced to leave the safe place our dreams represent? Can they make us do it? Will we ever find the strength enough to face the world? Do we have to? <br />Do we dare?<br /><blockquote>I sleep when I dream of what doesn't exist; dreaming of what might exist wakes me up. (179)</blockquote><br />Life should be about finding a sane balance between reality and fantasy. That reminds me of something I found the other day. I don't know if the following words really belong to Pizarnik—they sure sound like her—and since I couldn't find them in English, I kind of translated them. Trust me, they are too beautiful in Spanish. So, I apologize in advance. <br /><br /><i>I am simply not from this world... I frenziedly dwell in the moon. I am not afraid of dying; I am afraid of this foreign, aggressive land...<br />I cannot think about specific things; I am not interested. I cannot speak like everybody else. My words are foreign, they come from far away... What will I do when I plunge myself in my wildest dreams and cannot ascend? Because that is going to happen, eventually. I will go and I won't know how to come back. Moreover, I will not know that there is a ""coming back"". I will not want it, perhaps.</i><br /><br />No. Pessoa was not alone.<br /><br />According to this book, Soares was not a pessimist. He was sad. He suffered and dreamed. And he complained without knowing if suffering was the norm, if he deserved it for some reason. However, he rejoiced in the fact that he could play with his complaints and made them musical because he was an artist. He could give beauty to his complaints and dreams. <br />But, if you can't do that, if you are not an artist... well. What then?<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Note: I read the English (Zenith) and Spanish (Crespo) translations at the same time.

  </blockquote>
</i><br />Flow smoothly, book that does not realize its influence, supple prose poem with ignitions of profundity. Read slowly, reader who wishes never to see it end. <br /><br />One cannot read this book of fragmentary thoughts as quickly as one would others, for instead of plot or story, one finds style and syntax that reveal the human condition and psyche. So I read this one intentionally, wishing it would go on and on. Our protagonist and “voice” is that that of the solitary and observant older man, a writer who has never known the affections of childhood because he lost both his parents at a young age. What it must feel like to be loved, to feel the warmth of a mother’s hug, he ponders. He has never been in love, nor has he had any friends. In fact, he’s never had ambition, only his imagination and dreams:<br /><i>
  <b>
    <blockquote>Between myself and life there have always been panes of opaque glass, undetectable to me by sight or touch; I never actually lived life according to a plan, I was the daydream of what I wanted to be, my dream began in my will, my goal was always the first fiction of what I never was.</blockquote>
  </b>
</i><br />It is said that we learn more about life when we write, that we find ourselves within our prose (especially memoir writers). As I write this, I understand more about myself, and as I read his words, I realize that he and I are nothing alike, and yet we have so much in common:<br /><i>
  <b>
    <blockquote>I am, for the most part, the very prose that I write. I shape myself in periods and paragraphs, I punctuate myself and, in the unleashed chain of images, I make myself king, as children do, with a crown of made from a sheet of newspaper or, in finding rhythms in mere strings of words, I garland myself, as madmen do, with dried flowers that in my dreams still live.</blockquote>
  </b>
</i><br />This is the beauty of poignant prose, when we find pieces of ourselves within it. Someone should have given me this book years ago, when I was a teenager in a new country, recovering from war and struggling to find myself in a new world of structured freedom. Back then, I was living in tedium, as the narrator puts it. My new world was invigorating, yet scary, this idea that I could walk the streets freely (and not have to keep myself secluded from men and guns), that I could attend public high schools and apply for federal aid for college, that I could go to a library and read any book—better yet, buy books freely and form my very own library? Although this was great, it was also painful, to be faced with the realization that this world had existed even while I'd been in a different world of imprisonment. I never knew how to verbalize that pain until now:<br /><i>
  <blockquote>The pain of not understanding the mystery of life, the pain of being unloved, the pain of others’ injustice to us, the pain of life crushing us, suffocating and imprisoning us…</blockquote>
</i><br />To live in tedium is to die while still being alive, even while believing in staying alive: <i>""Life chills me. My existence is all damp caves and dark catacombs</i>."" To live in tedium is to hope for a second chance at life, where one can do the things one has always imagined doing. This is the core expression of this book, I believe, this art of mastering self-consciousness. The book is a solemn but necessary read, this is why I’ve recommended it to my students who are war survivors and to my veteran students who have just returned from Iraq and Afghanistan. And this is also why I would recommend it to <i>anyone</i> who is frustrated by, yet still fascinated with this thing called life. <br /><i>

"<br /><i>“My soul is a hidden orchestra; I know not what instruments, what fiddlestrings and harps, drums and tamboura I sound and clash inside myself. All I hear is the symphony.”</i><br /><br />An Orchestra of over 70 musicians, playing their own instruments, each producing an individual sound, a discrete voice, adding up from each corner, playing the distinctive notes of solitude, dream, rain and tedium, rising at one place while falling at another and producing a symphony so striking in its completion that it cannot be complete, like a painting frozen in time, striving for an expression it cannot possibly attain, and not because the painter isn’t skillful enough but because he chooses not to part from one, deliberately made imperceptible in the strokes, which is inherently his own. So while he did create 81 heteronyms* , each distinctly dissimilar in their style, we do not yet know who Pessoa actually was or what he believed in. <br /><br /><b>Fernando Pessoa, strictly speaking, doesn’t exist.</b>*<br /><br />Pessoa called this work as his <i>“factless biography”</i> I also came across the words <i>“Psychography”</i> and <i>“geography of self awareness”</i> for the book. In my opinion, it has distinct tones of the absurd, and can be looked upon as an absurdist writing albeit on an altogether different level, though the hints of stoicism and cynicism are apparently evident too. You will not notice the “babble/despair” - characteristic of Beckett’s writing or “Rational absurd” <input type=""checkbox"" class=""spoiler__control"" aria-label=""The following text has been marked spoiler.

Suicide seems a dubious remedy, and natural death – even assuming it brings unconsciousness – an insufficient one. Rather than the cessation of my existence, which may or may not be possible, this weariness makes me long for something far more horrifying and profound: never to have existed at all, which is definitely impossible.”</i> <br /><br />His conviction of being a passer-by reminds me of Beckett’s belief of being a passer-by who finds himself over and over again (The Unnameable).<br /><br /><i>“This is my morality, or metaphysics, or me: passer-by of everything, even of my own soul, I belong to nothing, I desire nothing, I am nothing – just an abstract center of impersonal sensations, a fallen sentient mirror reflecting the world’s diversity. I don’t know if I’m happy this way. Nor do I care.”</i><br /><br />To overcome the anguish of life which he is so acutely aware of, he engages in imagination and dreaming. Perhaps this is the reason he created so many personalities, so as to be able to experience different lives within him. In fact, his approach is distinct in the sense that he is not only aware of his sensations, but he also exercises a control over them which is clearly visible from the number of heteronyms he created for himself, who could each write in distinct literary styles. According to him:<br /><br /><b>“My intellect has attained a pliancy and a reach that enable me to assume any emotion I desire and enter at will into any state of mind.”</b>*<br /><br />This writing, which is a compilation of over 500 fragments, where each fragment, written perhaps on different days, seemingly an attempt at expressing the flow of thoughts or imagination capturing writer’s mind, does seem to have a structure in thoughts and more than often talks about solitude, dream, tedium and rain. <br /><br /><i>“It’s so hard to describe what I feel when I feel I really exist and my soul is a real entity that I don’t know what human words could define it. I don’t know if I have a fever, as I feel I do, or if I’ve stopped having the fever of sleeping through life. Yes, I repeat, I’m like a traveller who suddenly finds himself in a strange town, without knowing how he got there, which makes me think of those who lose their memory and for a long time are not themselves but someone else. I was someone else for a long time–since birth and consciousness –and suddenly I’ve woken up in the middle of a bridge, leaning over the river and knowing that I exist more solidly than the person I was up till now. But the city is unknown to me, the streets are new, and the trouble has no cure. And so, leaning over the bridge, I wait for the truth to go away and let me return to being fictitious and non-existent, intelligent and natural.”</i><br /><br />Keeping in mind that this work is written by <b>Bernardo Soares</b>, the heteronym considered to be the closest to Pessoa’s real self, these lines acutely express Pessoa’s yearning to live an imagined life, as if in a dream, so as to forget his actual self in real life. He writes about his dreams, their nature and importance and goes as far as giving advice regarding them:<br /><br /><i>“Live your life. Don’t be lived by it. Right or wrong, happy or sad, be your own self. You can do this only by dreaming, because your real life, your human life, is the one that doesn’t belong to you but to others. You must replace your life with your dreaming, concentrating only on dreaming perfectly. In all the acts of your real life, from that of being born to that of dying, you don’t act – you’re acted; you don’t live – you’re merely lived.”</i>(Art of effective dreaming II)<br /><br />Rain, which frequently appears in the text, seems a symbol of the incessant thoughts, pouring over writer’s mind and submerging his awareness in the disquiet that he experiences:<br /><br /><i>“Each drop of rain is my failed life weeping in nature. There’s something of my disquiet in the endless drizzle, then shower, then drizzle, then shower, through which the day’s sorrow uselessly pours itself out over the earth. It rains and keeps raining. My soul is damp from hearing it. So much rain… My flesh is watery around my physical sensation of it.”</i> ( Rainy Landscape)<br /><br />He profoundly expresses his tedium in words when he experiences it and also present to us different situations where one may feel tedium:<br /><br /><i>“Tedium… Perhaps, deep down, it is the soul’s dissatisfaction because we didn’t give it a belief, the disappointment of the sad child (who we are on the inside) because we didn’t buy it the divine toy. Perhaps it is the insecurity of one who needs a guiding hand and who doesn’t feel, on the black path of profound sensation, anything more than the soundless night of not being able to think, the empty road of not being able to feel…” </i><br /><br />And what is still more astonishing is that though he wrote these fragments in solitude, over perhaps a decade or more, he wrote it as a dialogue between him and the future reader, allowing for either acceptance or rejection on the part of reader. <br /><br /><i>And I offer you this book because I know it is beautiful and useless. It teaches nothing, inspires no faith, and stirs no feeling. A mere stream that follows towards an abyss of ashes scattered by the wind, neither helping nor harming the soil..... I put my whole soul into making it, but without thinking about it as I made it, for I thought only of me, who am sad, and of you, who aren’t anyone. And because this book is absurd, I love it; because it is useless, I want to give it away; and because it serves no purpose to want to give it to you, I give it to you…</i><br /><br />As I conclude my review, I want to admit that this book overwhelmed me immensely, I witnessed Pessoa seeping inside me slowly, making me quiver with the words he spoke to me, more as I understood them. Perceiving the disquiet which so fiercely plagued him, the solitude that he opted to dream to somehow conquer it, but still returning to the unrest because he understood the futility, made his thoughts trace through my mind, linger there for sometime before finally coming home to me. But my effort at writing a more personal review didn’t ensue because if written, it would have been nothing but <b>babble</b>. <br /><br />I am yet to complete reading Philosophical essays by Pessoa and the poems he wrote by the name of Albert Caeiro, but still I feel privileged to place him on the altar alongside Camus and Beckett. <br /><br />---------------------------------------<br /><br />*source - wikipedia<br /><br />*Written by his creation, Álvaro de Campos, Notes for the Memory of My Master Caeiro (Editorial Estampa, 1997).<br /><br />*From a “Personal note”, 1910<br /><br /><br />",5

"<i>The Book of Disquiet</i> should be read slowly and thoughtfully, savored and sipped like fine wine. It’s a groundbreaking work of Modernist experimentation that consists of a collection of writings found on disorganized scraps of paper in a chest found in the author’s home after his death. These scraps were assembled into a book for the first time in the 1960s. Pessoa, who was Portuguese, wrote the segments over the course of the last twenty years of his life, which ended in 1935.<br /><br />Pessoa invented multiple personas for himself that he called heteronyms, and each of his novels or collections of poetry was written from the perspective of an alter ego. He essentially invented multiple authors and wrote from their perspective. It’s a distinct approach from having a character narrate a novel, especially when it comes to writing a collection of poetry, but even in this “novel” because there is no plot to speak of, only an internal landscape. Pessoa makes no effort to distinguish his own critique of the “author’s opinions,” he merely embodies them. In other words, there is no authorial distance, no “unreliable narrator” theme, there is only the narrator. It is as if Pessoa had a multiple personality disorder in artistic form. The collection of writings in this book are measures of the interior life of one Bernardo Soares, which Pessoa described as being a “mutilated version” of himself, but perhaps the closest to his own beliefs of all his heteronyms. He describes Soares as rather like “himself minus the affection.” <br /><br />Indeed, Soares comes across as so purely intellectual (although he does have the occasional overwhelming emotional response to small occurrences) that he is rather distant and cold—completely self-absorbed and narcissistic, in fact. Soares lives a life that is almost entirely metaphysical. In one of the 276 segments in the book, he refers to this collection as a “book of disconnected impressions.” Some might say that this isn’t a novel! But in the case of what is important to Soares (or to Pessoa), intellectual thought is apparently the only process that sustains his life. It is the story of his life, which was very little but intellectual.<br /><br />We get glimpses of this persona at work, as an accountant poring over ledgers (which is what Pessoa did as well), and walking the streets of Lisbon, but for the most part, nothing ever happens. Soares lives a life only in his mind and in his daydreams. He is scared and reluctant to say hello or even shake hands with others. It is too shocking, too much for him. Much like Proust who wrote an entire series of book triggered by the taste of a single Madeleine cookie, Soares believes that an artist must be able to wring the greatest emotional effect out of the smallest incidents. So why write of large incidents when small ones suffice?<br /><br />What subjects does Soares ponder as we make our way through this book? What is the book about? Walking and weather. Fame and ambition, rain and dreams. Banality, the banality of existence. Change or the lack there of. Dreams, especially dreams. Work. God. Writing and art. Identity and being.<br /><br />At times he can seem quite humble, or more precisely, assured of his own inadequacy and contemptuous of himself, believing that everything he writes is worthless and a failure, railing at his own—and by proxy, every writers’—inability to truly represent ideas or thoughts in words (this being quite reminiscent of Wittgenstein’s view that language mediates our understanding of reality). Yet other times he can seem utterly arrogant in his narcissism. Other people are merely props for his internal dreams and thinking, and in fact he boldly declares at one point, “… of what importance is to me what life is to other people?” Because, he would say, we can only live life from our own perspective and to attempt “empathy” is a delusion. Other people aren’t even real to any of us—except as dreams.* Sometimes this seems almost Buddhist—we are dreaming life and because all is change, nothing is real and all there is is nothing. “The self is nothing more than all it is thinking in the moment.” Other times, it comes across as clearly Nietzschean, which would seem close to Pessoa's own ideology because he was a royalist of sorts. Soares believes that humans want to be enslaved not free. He has certain fascist tendencies that peek through his <i>primarily</i> apolitical musings. For example, he declares himself both anti-revolutionary and anti-reformist. Much like Nietzsche who sought to create amoral übermen, he is anti-social and believes that pursuing matters of social justice are not only a waste of time, but also a false presumption of pride and ambition in the self, to shape society. Furthermore, such actions support the premise that other people are “real” when in fact they are only dreams.** And then on the flipside of this, humans are unimportant and vulgar animals anyway: ""Life disgusts me."" <br /><br />When he talks about work, he seems to say that work (not artist work, but paid commercial work) is an opportunity to become nothing—a mere tool, a non-thing—and to Soares, this is good, this is the enslavement that people want. The more the self can vanish as meaningless, the better. He criticizes ambition to “do something better” as pure vanity.<br /><br />How can I give this book four stars when there are such disagreeable elements? Well, firstly, one doesn’t have to agree with everything in a book philosophically to find it a great book. Sometimes, finding a point of view that one can disagree with is just as valuable. And secondarily, he spends most of the book pondering apolitical questions on the nature of perception, emotion, and identity revealing brilliant bon mots that remind me of Montaigne such as, “There is nothing that shows poverty of mind more quickly than not knowing how to be witty except at the expense of others.” Admittedly, I did feel at times as though I were slogging through an ambiguous fog that didn’t quite make sense, but then I would come to a burst of insight like a spotlight that illuminates the way. In the end, these insights (whether they be about life in general, or whether they gave me insights into certain types of people with tendencies like the narrator), were often profound enough to elevate this book to quite a high status.<br /><br />All in all, this book will only appeal to those readers comfortable with deep thoughts lacking a plot, and willing to persevere, but the rewards can be great.<br /><br />*I counter this by noting that if everything is a dream and everyone is a dream then all that matters is dreams and empathy for dreams is just as valid as non-empathy for dreams. <br /><br />**It’s important to recognize that someone is always shaping society—those who are already in power. Therefore, in fact, passively supporting the status quo is just as much a political action as resisting the status quo. It’s merely the path of least resistance…that is, until your freedom or means of survival are at stake.",4
"<br />""<i>The magical power of words, whether isolated or brought together to form a musical chord, full of intimate resonances and meanings that diverge even as they converge, the pomp of sentences placed in between the meanings of other sentences, malicious vestiges, hopeful woods, and nothing but the peaceful pools in the childhood gardens of my subterfuges… Thus, between the high walls of absurd audacity, among the lines of trees and the startled shivers of things withering, someone other than me would hear from sad lips the confession denied to the more insistent. Not even if the knights were to ride back down the road visible from atop the castle wall would there be more peace in the Castle of the Last Lost Men, where once lances clashed and clanged in the courtyard, nor would anyone recall another name on this side of the road, apart from the one that used to enchant us nightly, like the tale about the Moorish ladies, and the child who died afterwards from life and wonder.</i>""",5
"Lisbon is a place to fall in love. Doorways with mosaics promise romance. Outside, the air is salty as flesh from the sea. Inside, the soulful sound of fado is not a dream but wears a shawl or dark mustache. When you rise to leave, the owner stops you. ""I'm going to play,"" he says and leads you back. He orders a table and chair brought next to the stage. You sit. He takes up a guitar. That's my Lisbon, not Pessoa's.<br /><br />Yet, we share another Lisbon. That is the city in which writers, particularly poets, dwell. It is built on words that wind up narrow streets so steep there are stairs. We traverse this city with pens. Alone, yet never lonely. As Pessoa says, ""words are tangible bodies, visible sirens, sensualities made flesh."" And there are ""delights in surrender."" Suffering, too. <br /><br />As a guidebook to that Lisbon of the mind, expect no maps. Just open The Book of Disquiet and wander its pages.",4

The author created an entire world of characters in himself, seeing no journey more important than that of the one into oneself. I have not created my own host of fellow souls, but I am intimately familiar with the ever present malaise, the hesitance toward human interaction, the constant worry over ones reputation with others (strangers on the streets to valued friends to all levels of knowing). Ever present dreaming, ever present distraction, ever present evaluation alongside analysis of the self. Proclaiming the uselessness of everything, yet never making the final step. Dreaming of the novel yet knowing that the novel will never happen so long as the familiar remains itself. Playing mental games to deal with the thinking, the feeling, the hopes and desires suffocated in a soul with myriad reasons for not chasing them.What is the cause of this? What chemical pattern of brain influenced by the combination of genes sinks the self down into introversion, into deep safe waters, always craving yet disdaining yet loving yet loathing the concept and existence of the sun. Who knows.<br /><br />I have not gone as deep as this one here though, and I would have to say that this is better. I don't envy his existence. I see what he has written and can claim multitudes of passages as original thoughts, made by myself upon analysis of our similar existences. There is a quote that says loneliness conveys the sorrow of being alone, while solitude expresses the joy. I look at this book, twenty years of solitude, and I see no solution beyond that of a mindset that I am unwilling to embrace. Falling back on religion is not something I plan on doing anytime soon. Nor will I turn the pain of loneliness into pleasure. I am not so vindictive against humanity as of yet. <br /><br />This book defines a patch of my soul, but I will not let that patch define me; reading this is just another milestone in my path of figuring out my self, and how to allow myself to live as I desire. A wake up call, of sorts. It will be worth rereading if I ever start sinking into this train of thought; it'll definitely be a sign that I need a change, a vacation of sorts. I haven't yet lost the appreciation of the novel, and I'll be using this book as a reminder of what can happen if I ever do so. A resource against calamity indeed.",5
"<i>The Book of Disquiet</i> is a LiveJournal blog as written by E.M. Cioran or Albert Camus.<br /><br />Bernardo Soares, Pessoa’s leading alter-ego, imagines “the corpse of [his] prose” being “lowered into general oblivion” upon his death. This might have been the case had not archivists rescued his fragmented idlings from the black void and published them in this volume.<br /><br />It strikes me, given Soares’s desire for extinction, and the delusion of posterity, that this selection of writing is redundant. What impact can one man’s daydreams, solipsistic tracts, repetitive observations, written from a chronically depressed mind, have on another? What is the function of this book? If the writer is so intent on being ignored, on doting on life’s gloominess, why should we waste our time lauding the prettiness of his prose? <br /><br />Would he care that a legion of people find this book a philosophical masterpiece, that we empathise with his eternal struggle with everyday life, with his permanent existential misery? No: he is only happy in dreams.<br /><br />This is similar to <a href=""http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/189034.Marcel_Benabou"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Marcel Benabou</a>’s <a href=""http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/355501.Why_I_Have_Not_Written_Any_of_My_Books_Pourquoi_je_n_ai_ecrit_aucun_de_mes_livres"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">nonbook</a>: it is the very fact of its valuelessness that gives it its value. In practice, at least. With <i>The Book of Disquiet</i>, Soares has written himself into extinction. ",1
"<b>Like a Version (Touched for the Very First Time)</b><br /><br />This is an exceptional book or work or whatever you want to call it.<br /><br />However, ultimately, I found it both fascinating and (just a little bit) frustrating.<br /><br />One source of frustration is that, upon completing it, I discovered that the version I had read (translated by Margaret Jull Costa) was 262 pages, whereas the Penguin Classics version (translated by Richard Zenith) is 544 pages. I hate it when this happens. I feel duped. Nothing had forewarned me of this possibility.<br /><br />Readers have different views on the merits of the translations. I was perfectly happy with the quality of the text in the version I read (plus I love the cover!). However, the sheer difference in length has made me question whether and, if so, how much, text was omitted from the earlier version. <br /><br />This might not be such a big deal. If indeed there is a difference in the amount of text, I imagine that much of it might have replicated what was included in the original version. There is already considerable duplication in the work. Alternatively, it might have consisted of complementary material, the absence of which did not detract from the content of the original version.<br /><br />Regardless, the fact that this issue occurred at all points to another cause of my frustration.<br /><br /><b>Fragments from under the Floorboards</b><br /><br />Both versions of the work have been presented to the reader as if it was a novel. It's even suggested that it's one of the great Modernist novels of the 20th Century.<br /><br />I don't want to be precious about the definition of the word ""novel"". As far as I'm concerned, if the author thinks their work is a novel, that's good enough for me.<br /><br />However, here, the work as a whole (in whatever version) has been assembled by a team of experts and editors from a trunk full of hundreds or thousands of fragments.<br /><br />It's not clear whether Pessoa regarded the project as a novel. Nor is it clear whether he regarded any version or part of the project as a finished work. Or in what order he would have presented the work or novel, had he finished it.<br /><br />The sequence in which the fragments have been ordered (presumably, from a selection) is actually a triumph of sympathetic editing.<br /><br />However, I'm not sure whether, if the author intended the work to be a novel, it would have looked anything like what I read.<br /><br />To the extent that its formal concerns might qualify it as a work of Modernist fiction, you have to ask whether they derive from the author or his editors.<br /><br /><b>Textual Personae</b><br /><br />I am nevertheless equally fascinated by the metafictional pretence behind its submission to the reader.<br /><br />The work purports to be the product of the heteronymic author, Bernardo Soares, a figment of Pessoa's imagination.<br /><br />Soares was not just a pseudonym for Pessoa writing as himself. He was a fully-fledged persona, clearly differentiated from Pessoa and many other heteronyms he used to imagine and write other discrete aspects of his work. <br /><br />Thus, the existence of the heteronym allowed Pessoa to fully explore aspects of his imagination, aesthetics and philosophy, without any limitation inferred from its ultimate source in the one person. (Mind you, Pessoa acknowledged that Soares most resembled his true self [<i>""me minus reason and affectivity""</i>], to the extent there might only have been one.)<br /><br />The result is that this work is not just fragmentary in its own right. It is the product of a fragmented author.<br /><br />Whether or not it was ever intended to be a novel (by either of its <i>""authors""</i>), the work itself (or at least the analysis of it) fits within the concerns of Modernism, if not Post-Modernism (which I maintain is a branch of Modernism, a sub-movement, not a separate movement).<br /><br /><b>Melancholy Nihilism</b><br /><br />The fragmentation also reflects the philosophical concerns of the author(s).<br /><br />Ultimately, I sense that this is a philosophical work, rather than a fictional work.<br /><br />It's a fragmented, but ultimately comprehensive and systematic, contemplation of the narrator's world and his place in it. The narrator is a thinker, not a man of action. Little happens in the work other than thinking about the self and its relationship with others and the world. It's not quite solipsistic, because the narrator acknowledges the existence of the outside world. However, for him, his own mind is of paramount concern.<br /><br />The editors have assembled the fragments in a thematic way, even though the same themes appear multiple times in the finished text. It could equally have been organised a different way. Or distilled into a short work of melancholy wisdom.<br /><br />The work is a testament to inveterate egoism, miserabilism and misanthropy. Yet, it's been fashioned into a comprehensible philosophy.<br /><br />If sub-headings were added as signposts, it would make a fantastic guide to nihilism or whatever you want to call this particular philosophy. I am reluctant to describe it as Existentialism, because of the apparent lack of Humanism.<br /><br />Whatever you call it, it purports to be a philosophy made by a melancholy person for melancholy people, to the extent that there is any concern for others at all. <br /><br />Its closest fictional parallel is Dostoyevsky's <i>""Notes from Underground"".</i><br /><br /><b>Prepossessing Aphorisms</b><br /><br />It's hard to say how much readers are expected to distance themselves from the ostensible authors or their philosophy. <br /><br />Even if it's serious, it would be ironic if only sad or self-pitying readers related to or enjoyed this work.<br /><br />Its beauty resides in the quality of writing, which can be enjoyed by all readers with a metaphysical bent.<br /><br />Indeed, if all philosophy were conceived and written this lyrically, it wouldn't be the preserve of desk-bound, incomprehensible polysyllabists and LL.B.'s that it seems to have become.<br /><br />This work is as literary and aphoristic as Friedrich Nietzsche, Oscar Wilde and George Bernard Shaw.<br /><br />You can understand and enjoy it, even if you don't agree or sympathise with its underlying philosophy.<br /><br />Ultimately, for this reason alone, it is a creative work, if not necessarily fiction.<br /><br />Still, there is always the possibility that the fiction lies in the creation of a non-fiction work by a fictitious author, narrator or character (as ably assisted by the experts and editors)! It's hard to tell whether the metaphysics is bona fide or purely metafictional.<br /><br />The whole text or philosophy might even be ironic. Who knows? Perhaps Johnny Marr could put it to music!<br /><br />At least this prospect makes it good for a laugh or maybe even a dance. Roger Wilco Foxtrot!<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>""A Mercator Projection of the Soul""<br />[An Assemblage of Aphorisms]</b><br /><br />Below are some aphorisms that map the metaphysical journey of the work:<br /><br /><b>Life and the Abyss:</b><br /><br /><i>Life would be unbearable if we were truly conscious of it. (212)</i><br /><br /><i>
  <b>If there is one thing life gives us, apart from life itself, and for which we must thank the gods, it is the gift of not knowing ourselves: of not knowing ourselves and of not knowing one another. The human soul is an abyss of viscous darkness...no one would love themselves if they really knew themselves...(236)</b>
</i><br /><br /><b>Nihilism and Illusion:</b><br /><br /><i>In order not to demean ourselves in our own eyes, it is enough that we should become accustomed to harbouring no ambitions, passions, desires, hopes, impulses or feelings of restlessness.(186)</i><br /><br /><i>
  <b>Once we believe this world to be merely an illusion and a phantasm, we are then free to consider everything that happens to us as a dream, something that only pretended to because we were asleep.(220)</b>
</i><br /><br /><b>Death and Inaction:</b><br /><br /><i>I've become a character in a book, a life already dead. Quite against my wishes, what I feel is felt in order for me to write it down.(139)</i><br /><br /><i>
  <b>Living seems to me a metaphysical mistake on the part of matter, an oversight on the part of inaction.(114)</b>
</i><br /><br /><b>Looking and Feeling:</b><br /><br /><i>For me, humanity is one vast decorative motif, existing through one's eyes and ears and through psychological emotion. I demand nothing more from life than to be a spectator of it. I demand nothing more from myself than to be a spectator of life.(198)</i><br /><br /><i>
  <b>I am an endlessly sensitive photographic plate. In me every tiny detail is recorded and magnified in order to form part of a whole. I concern myself only with myself. For me the external world is pure sensation. I never forget what I feel.(178)</b>
</i><br /><br /><b>Egoism and Disquiet:</b><br /><br /><i>That is my morality or my metaphysics or me myself: a passer-by in everything, even in my own soul. I belong to nothing, I desire nothing, I am nothing except an abstract centre of impersonal sensations, a sentient mirror fallen from the wall but still turned to reflect the diversity of the world. I don't care if this makes me happy or unhappy, and I don't much care.(151)</i><br /><br /><i>
  <b>The generation to which I belong was born into a world devoid of certainty for anyone possessed of both an intellect and a heart...the world into which we were born had no security to offer us as regards religion, no anchor as regards morality, no stability as regards politics. We were born into a state of anguish, both metaphysical and moral, and of political disquiet.(206)</b>
</i><br /><br /><b>Love and Onanism:</b><br /><br /><i>We never love anyone. We love only our idea of what someone is like. We love an idea of our own; in short, it is ourselves that we love...The onanist may be an abject creature but in truth he is the logical expression of the lover. He is the only one who neither disguises nor deludes himself.(218)</i><br /><br /><i>
  <b>To love is merely to grow tired of being alone: it is therefore both cowardice and a betrayal of ourselves (it is vitally important that we should not love).(240)</b>
</i><br /><br /><b>Futility and Nothingness:</b><br /><br /><i>The one reason we get on together is that we know nothing about one another.</i><br /><br /><i>
  <b>Love disturbs and wearies, action dissipates and disappoints, no one truly knows how to know, and thinking confuses everything. Better then to put a stop to all our desires and hopes, to our futile attempts to explain the world, or to any foolish ambitions to change or govern it. Everything is nothing...(242)</b>
</i><br /><br /><b>Tedium and Worthlessness:</b><br /><br /><i>Tedium is not a sickness brought on by the boredom of having nothing to do, but the worse sickness of feeling that nothing is worth doing.(91)</i><br /><br /><i>
  <b>Tedium is boredom with the world, the malaise of living, the weariness of having lived; in truth, tedium is the feeling in one's flesh of the endless emptiness of things.(122)</b>
</i><br /><br /><b>Silence and Emptiness:</b><br /><br /><i>I feel this because I feel nothing. I think this because this is all nothing.

"<b>A Book That Changed My Life</b><br /><br />A book worth reading once a year. <br /><br />In 2023, my goal is to consume less and create more. The stories in my heart and mind were finally going to meet paper. But I wasn’t actually writing anything. <br /><br />When the day started, I knew that I had to write. I wasn’t feeling very well so I would write later. Then, dinner would happen, and I was behind on my reading and didn’t feel any better than earlier in the day. <br /><br />Enter Atomic Habits. After reading the book, I took out my calendar and scheduled, “Writing,” from 1 pm to 1:20 pm. Now, I am actually writing.<br /><br />How many of us have goals: to have better relationships, to lose weight, to learn a language? We have the best of intentions, but we don’t have a plan with manageable actionable steps.<br /><br />Have you ever wondered how I got to be the #3 US Book Reviewer on GoodReads? Atomic Habits.<br /><br />Before reading Atomic Habits, I had what I now realize as wishful thinking or dreams. At times, sometimes I made it on to the top 100 book reviewers, but it was always a complete mystery to me. When I made the list, I couldn't believe my luck! I wanted to rate higher, but I had no real plan.<br /><br />Then, I read Atomic Habits. I sat down and had a clearly articulated goal. ""I want to rate X on the best reviewer list."" Okay. Sounds great. But what does that take? I looked at where I wanted to be on the weekly list and saw how many votes the reviewer received. I divided that number by 7 and knew that I needed to achieve that many votes per day to get to where I needed to be. <br /><br />Sure enough. I met my goal and started to become consistently ranked. Atomic Habits is all about shifting your dreams and wishful thinking into knowing exactly where you want to be and making a plan to get there.<br /><br />Also, it talks about lofty goals.<br /><br />Almost everybody can relate. We make lofty goals: I’m going to run a marathon! I’m going to write a book! I’m going to lose weight! After a few weeks of intense effort (if we make it that far), we give up and go back to the way things were.<br /><br />Did you know that I got back into reading by reading 6 books a year? That’s right. My goal was 6 books per year. <br /><br />The only reason that I initially picked up this book was that someone was RAVING about it, and I was extremely skeptical. I honestly thought that this book was just going to be a bunch of rah rah feel good, you can do it, pep talk. However, it had an entire list of actionable steps you can take to help you make progress on your goals. <br /><br />Little changes can make big differences over time. For example, when I lay out my sheet mask in the morning, I am much more likely to use it at night. This book made me want to write down goals for the year or at least start thinking of the things I wanted to make a priority. <br /><br />This is my second reading of Atomic Habits, and I read it as a buddy read (which I highly recommend). It is interesting to hear about other systems.<br /><br />During this read of Atomic Habits, I was struck by the idea of becoming 1% better.<br /><br />Growing up, I really enjoyed playing basketball. The game is fast-paced, and it was one game where I could actually score. However, I can’t jump very high. I was so fixated on this weak area that I convinced myself that I couldn’t be a basketball player.<br /><br />But you know what? I can sink three-pointers like nobody’s business. At Dave and Buster’s, I can easily achieve the high score. What if I didn’t give up? What if I spent my time trying to get better at running, aiming, teamwork, dribbling? <br /><br />As an overachiever, I do tend to obsess over my weak areas. I spend so much time on the weak area that I ignore some of my other talents. What would I achieve if I just accepted that I am not great in a particular area but focused my time on other areas? Would I enjoy the journey more?<br /><br />If you have tried losing weight or training, I would highly recommend this book. I can definitely see myself reading this once every year—it really is that good!<br /><br />2024 Reading Schedule	<br />Jan	Middlemarch<br />Feb	The Grapes of Wrath<br />Mar	Oliver Twist<br />Apr	Madame Bovary<br />May	A Clockwork Orange<br />Jun	Possession<br />Jul	The Folk of the Faraway Tree Collection<br />Aug	Crime and Punishment<br />Sep	Heart of Darkness<br />Oct	Moby-Dick<br />Nov	Far From the Madding Crowd<br />Dec	A Tale of Two Cities<br /><br /><b>Connect With Me!</b><br /><a href=""https://lisaoftroy.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Blog</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/Lisa_of_Troy"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Twitter</a> <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvmSewQ0IGOzDnuMZNUKTbg"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">BookTube</a> <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/LisaofTroy"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Facebook</a> <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/lisa_of_troy/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Insta</a>",5
"This book does a great job of laying down the framework of how habits are formed, and shares insightful strategies for building good habits and breaking bad ones. Even though I was already familiar with research behind habit formation, reading through this book helped me approach habits I’m trying to adopt or break in my own life from different angles.<br /><br />But the book suffers from the same problems that seem to plague all self-help books. In the chapter about tracking habits, the author shares an anecdote about Benjamin Franklin’s habit of carrying a journal everywhere to track thirteen virtues. If you care to know more about that story, Franklin tried to make a habit of his thirteen virtues by turning it into a thirteen week course where he would work on a different virtue every week and track his progress. The author conveniently leaves out the fact that Franklin quickly found this method impractical and abandoned the project before getting through all thirteen virtues. There’s a lot of irony in including this anecdote in a chapter that talks about the importance of not “breaking the chain”. So while the author isn’t entirely wrong, I found it off-putting that he would retell this story in a manner that fit his narrative. This is a vice that is found all too commonly in self-help and pop science books that make you question the author’s intellectual rigour.<br /><br />Another criticism I have of this book is that it could have been even shorter. The last few chapters under “Advanced Tactics” that deal with the topic of mastery were the weakest in the book. While there is an obvious connection between habits and mastery, trying to tie in a topic as complex as mastery was perhaps too ambitious.<br /><br />The three star rating I am giving this book doesn’t reflect how important I consider habits to be. I completely agree with the author that habits are the cornerstone of your life. If you want to change your life in any meaningful way, the only dependable way I know is to build good habits. If you need convincing that habits are important, I would strongly recommend this book. If you are already convinced but struggling to adopt or break habits, racing through this book will give you some good ideas about how you can make changes stick.<br />",3
"TLDR; <br />- ""You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.""<br />- The best way of building a habit is making it part of your identity.<br />- Make it easy to start: Habits are the entry point - not the goal. ""Read 30 books"" ⇒ ""Read before bed every night"" ⇒ ""Read one page"". Reduce a habit into a 2-minute first step.<br />- Stick to the plan: ""Professionals stick to the schedule, amateurs let life get in the way."" Don't be a ""fair weather runner"" if you want to run a lot.<br />- Make it hard to do the things you want to avoid.<br /><br />Most modern ""American self-help books for engineers or entrepreneurs"" (it is a category for me) are too repetitive and too long. Atomic Habits is not! It does have the category-required set of stories of American (mostly men) who built a great habit and got to the top - but just the right amount. <br /><br />----- NOTES -----<br /><br />*Identity*<br />The three levels of change - the lower the more ""fundamental"":<br />3. Outcomes = Your goals <br />2. Processes = Your system<br />1. Identity = Who you perceive yourself to be<br /><br />Make every action is a vote for what kind of person you want to become. Building habits is becoming the version of yourself you want to be. Habits help you to trust yourself. <br />- Realize that ""You don't _have to_ do anything, you _get to_."" <br />- Ask ""What would a healthy person do?"". <br />- Ask ""What feel like fun to you, but is work to others?""<br /><br /><br />*Engineer it so that:*<br />Things you want to achieve vs Things you want to avoid<br />Obvious —————————————— Invisible<br />Attractive ————————————Unattractive<br />Easy ————————————————— Hard<br />Satisfying ————————————- Satisfying<br />For example: if you want to watch less TV - keep it unplugged - only plugin if you can say out loud the name of the show you want to watch.",5

</blockquote> What a doozy of a quote. I guess it pays to be a prideful guy. <br /><br />Well, it seems luck isn't on my side when it comes to personal development reads, and ""Atomic Habits"" by James Clear is no exception. Despite the hype surrounding it, I find myself once again let down by a tired, regurgitated pop psychology book that fails to deliver.<br /><br />The information presented feels like a rehash of what I've stumbled upon in the productivity blogosphere for the past decade. But it's not just the lack of freshness that bothers me—it's the execution. The writing feels robotic, the repetition grows tiresome, and the cherry-picked anecdotes conveniently support the author's points, often taken out of context. Even the scientific references feel shaky and questionable at times.<br /><br />While the core ideas explored in ""Atomic Habits"" aren't inherently bad, they've already been covered by other authors with more depth and skill. Writers like Kelly McGonigal and George Leonard come to mind, offering a richer exploration of the subject matter. Frankly, I can't help but feel that the material in this book could have easily been condensed into a blog post or article. Instead, what I encounter is a bloated book filled with unnecessary fluff, making it feel like an extended infomercial for the author's blog. It's evident that this is just another platform to boost his personal brand and generate 'passive income'.<br /><br />I guess the world really needed another privileged marketer with an A-type personality telling people they can become like him if they follow his 'secret formula.' It seems tailor-made for a specific group of individuals—those who aspire to be the lifestyle-hacker extraordinaire, like Tim Ferris, and his devoted followers.<br /><br />P.S.<br />I should note that despite my disappointment, I've come across individuals who found value in this book, claiming it transformed their lives. However, in most of those cases, they failed to sustain the new habits they initially adopted and years later it's like they never read the book. <br /><br />While ""Atomic Habits"" didn't meet my personal expectations, it may still hold potential for people who are new to the subject or resonate with the author's approach. And hey, if it floats your boat and makes you feel like the captain of your own destiny, who am I to rain on your parade? Happy reading!",2
"The first great book about habits was the Power of Habit. That book was quite theoretical and difficult to apply. This book, Atomic Habits, has a completely different approach. James Clear focused on writing a book that goes deep into every single step of habit creation from a practical point of view. At the end of the day, <b>who we are and what we will achieve depends so much on these small habits that we do every day</b>. James Clear argues, that focusing only on improving those habits will lead to much bigger changes and accomplishments.<br /><br />My top 3 takeaways from this book are:<br /><br />* Forget about goals, <b>focus on the system instead</b>.<br />* Change your identity <b>to change your habits</b>.<br />* Motivation is overrated. <b>Design the environment to support your habits</b>.<br /><br />From this book, I distilled <b>21 strategies and principles on habit creation, and also I wrote a detailed book summary</b> that you can read here: <a target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" href=""https://www.mentorist.app/books/atomic-habits-an-easy-proven-way-to-build-good-habits-break-bad-ones/?src=goodreads"">https://www.mentorist.app/books/atomi...</a>",5
"This book and Emotional Intelligence Habits by Travis Bradberry are my two favorite self-improvement books. Atomic Habits teaches you how small habits (many of which you aren't even aware of) compound over time to make a huge difference in your life. When you work to form good habits they accumulate and build upon each other and you see major changes with very small actions. The book has some suggested habits, but I wish there were many more (specific recommendations for good habits to adopt). That's why I love Emotional Intelligence Habits so much. Emotional Intelligence Habits has more than 700 different habits targeting everything from happiness, confidence, likeability, relationships, leadership, productivity, dealing with toxic people, you name it. It's an incredible book and these two go great together.",5
"<b>“Changes that seem small and unimportant at first will compound into remarkable results if you’re willing to stick with them for years. We all deal with setbacks but in the long run, the quality of our lives often depends on the quality of our habits.""</b><br /><br />Did not live up to the hype. There’s good material here, and easy-to-follow strategies to improve our habits, but I found it a chore to wade through. My interest ebbed and flowed and ironically, I felt it could be the book to undo my healthy reading habits and routine.<br /><br /><i>Atomic Habits</i> succeeded in bringing awareness to my daily habits and making me more 'present'. The likes of “habit stacking” and “habit tracking” are things that I have started implementing since reading this. But while it’s great to be self-aware and regularly analyse our behaviours, I found it tiresome after a while.<br /><br /><i>“Daily habits are powerful because of how they compound, but worrying too much about every daily choice is like looking at yourself in the mirror from an inch away. You can see every imperfection and lose sight of the bigger picture.”</i><br /><br />Tedious.<br /><br />James Clear gives many examples of famous people who achieved success via their approach to habits. I enjoyed reading some of those, but far too often, content felt like it was being regurgitated from other books and work in the field of habits and human psychology. Sometimes it felt like he had simply thrown catchy new titles on pre-existing ideas and methods. Other times, it just seemed like common sense.<br /><br />The book is not just about developing good habits and sticking to them, but about eliminating bad ones. I was pleased to see reference to <i>Allen Carr’s Easy Way to Stop Smoking</i> – a book that already made a huge difference to my life! The importance of patience, the difference between 'motion'/'action' and the two-minute rule (when starting a new habit, it should take less than two minutes to do) were all takeaways that resonated with me.<br /><br />The chapter summaries were helpful to remember key points, but also made it clear there was substantial filler surrounding a couple of main ideas. These ideas are solid guidelines though, and no doubt helpful for building a better life - I guess time will tell.<br /><br />It's perhaps worth noting that my grievances with <i>Atomic Habits</i> are in the minority - many find this book amazing, so don't let my words prevent you reading this if you think it could be helpful. After all, I'm left wanting to eat healthier, improve my bedtime routines and embrace minimalism - so all this has to be good. <br /><br /><b>“Your actions reveal how badly you want something. If you keep saying something is a priority but you never act on it, then you don’t really want it. It’s time to have an honest conversation with yourself. Your actions reveal your true motivations.”</b>",3
"<b>I was prepared to dislike this book but I really enjoyed it!</b><br /><br />I've seen it on so many list of ""life-changing non fiction"" next to deeply misogynistic authors and it's popular with people promoting hustle culture so I didn't expect it to work for me.<br /><br />While I can't say that the information in it is that different from other books I've read on the topic, it's definitely the best breakdown of said info that I've seen.<br /><br />Super accessible, bitesize chapters... absolutely go with the audiobook if you enjoy them. I didn't want to sit while reading it because I was too busy reorganizing my space while listening to it!<br /><br />Worth it",5
"Reading this book feels like reading a homework assignment. James Clear wanted to read a lot of books and make a summary of the concepts he would implement for self-improvement. He also made a point in improve himself in the most hacky way possible. Instead of keeping the summary as personal notes, he published it. The fact that the author boasts about being a writer only makes it worse. You can actually smell the cheap tools he uses to put words into text and build chapters out of thin air. I wanted this book to get better, but it doesn't, up to the very end the author repeats the same choice pattern:<br /><br />* Tell them what you are going to tell them, tell them, tell them what you told them.<br />* Simplify science to the border of being wrong. <br />* Abuse of ""as such person said ___INSERT QUOTE HERE____""<br />* Build each chapter out of unacknowledged (stolen/refurbished) concepts, coming from other writings that predate this book.<br /><br />The last point is particularly annoying and the book is plagued by them. He even uses the same graphics and plots as the originals! He includes verbatim whole poems by Lao Tse or writings by Seneca. At least these are attributed and not refurbished. <br />If you are somewhat familiar with the literature, avoid this book.<br />If you are thinking about reading this book, think about the books the author got the content from. Go and read those, you will get the original content without the coarse editing by James Clear. You will also get better foundations for growing a mindset instead of implementing hacks.<br /><br />Start with Why - Simon Sinek<br />Mastery - George Leonard<br />Outliers - Malcom Gladwell<br />The Tipping Point - Malcom Gladwell<br />Getting Things Done - David Allen<br />The Element - Ken Robinson<br />Behave - Robert Sapolsky [Science communication written by experts in the field]<br />Thinking Fast and Slow - Daniel Kahneman [Science communication written by experts in the field]<br />",1
"The nuclear option for pimping, rebranding, fine-tuning, and perfecting grey cells. <br />Atomic also in one regard: As long as it works, it´s perfect down to the smallest part, each atom. If it fails, it´s radioactive and self cannibalizing, -destructing- and demotivating. <br /><br />To exaggerate, we can develop great working, social. and creative habits or destroy ourselves with neuroticism going haywire, find great ways to optimate oneself or madness, just read anecdotal filled pop psychology/science/philosophy books one can read without the danger of the hard work of really changing something or choose the difficult way and this book.<br /><br />The 1st Law Make it obvious<br />Repetition and consequence, as if it wasn´t so shamefully obvious, is one of the key elements to everything, a skill, foreign language, school, degrees,… and the funny thing is that successful people use learning, creativity, memo-, techniques to perfect their skills, but forget the motivational, critical thinking, analytic retrospection, optimization, meditation-,… techniques, and, most importantly, to recapitulate, criticize oneself, let others criticize oneself, reflect, and develop. There is always some space left toward top performance but without modifying or even changing habits, they won´t be possible and nothing is more painful than stopping a working, well known, perfected, but ineffective habit, using an oldfashioned program, modify a schedule, use knowledge and expertise in a new, complicated, unknown way, etc. The brain is a bit bitchy, nagging, and one´s worst enemy, because it´s a lazy manipulator, not wanting one to do something that means real work for it, trying to make it feel as uncomfortable as possible, wanting easy stagnation instead of sweaty evolution. <br /><br />The 2nd Law and 3rd Law Make it attractive and easy<br />As if this wasn´t already painful and difficult enough, the self experimental subject now has to implement unused, and thereby for the crying, sobbing, angry brain very painful, new neuronal integrated circuits because, as one knows, reptile stem brain and monkeys social anxiety wants one to run far away from everything new, different, possibly dangerous. Here the inner demons have to been disguised as angels to make the whole agony as attractive as possible, a kind of hopeful masochism. Detecting the deficits has already wasted vast resources of willpower and now one doesn´t even have the legitimation to kill and destroy positive change with anger and negative emotions, but the new mind baby has to be raised next to the rascals one has to be tolerant and sympathetic towards.<br /><br />The 4th Law Make it satisfying<br />Reaching this point is tricky, as one needs the stamina, perseverance, and resilience not to resign. As the old behaviors often aren´t directly harmful, just unproductive and used, they will come whispering and trying to get a hold of the subconscious mind to develop back towards the beginning. Humans are creatures of habit and whenever one just loses track and motivation for a second, their siren calls will try to lure you into old behaviors whose reminiscences are still lurking behind each screen, interaction, or working process.<br /><br />And as if all of this wasn´t torture enough, it should come with personal development and vivisecting one´s personality, thoughts, memories, all these things that seemingly aren´t directly related to work, too. Because hidden in the chasms of each simulated reality lies the key to boosting the occupational performance even more by eliminating all the mental corpses of complexes, childhood traumas, anxieties, phobias,… As long they are not overcome, they keep holding one down, interrupting the workflow, reducing concentration, focus, the quality of sleep,… even changing the obvious problems won´t unleash the full potential.<br /><br />A tip, after I´ve read a few of the most highly recommended DIY self brainwashing mind penetrating behavioral modification endeavor books for dummies, I´ve come to the conclusion that most of the theory, techniques, and schedules can easily be found during a longer google search, a Wikipedia or special wiki and Reddit, Quora walk, just using the essential keywords, bookmarking a few dozens to hundreds of pages of interest, copying the subjectively most essential and useful elements and still begin with the 1st law. But it would at least have cost you nothing. <br /><br />It´s getting a bit anecdotally and subjective now, even personal (cause people seem to like that stuff for whatever reason) and, of course, misanthropic, so don´t be shy to stop reading here and saving time and eye power that could be focused on reading something profound. Seriously, I´ve warned you.<br /><br />One of my main advantages is that I am naturally neurotic, a bit of still under control and productive, not negative elements of perfectionism, some might say soft OCD, but who listens to people, pedantic; a bit antisocial, and cold, rational, things very helpful when implementing new behavioral patterns because one doesn´t care about whatever other people think. <br /> <br />I am a bit biased here, because I have the, depending on the standpoint, positive or negative tendency to overachieve and excessively focus on one thing for weeks and months up to 12 or 14 hours a day, obsessive might be an understatement, let´s call it possession instead. Afterward, it´s often difficult to say how the final results, ideas, solutions paths developed, but conditioning oneself to combine focus and flow to hard fun and gamification, optional collaborative learning, yuck, might be a good alternative to just partying hard.<br /> <br />This leads me to the extroverts that might face massive deficits in this regard, as they have the unfortunate tendency to spent much unproductive time with other people, leading to excessive, exponentially growth of sympathy, friendship, contact, dangerous pheromones, endorphins, territorial alpha behavior,… manipulating logical thinking, in the worst case not just resulting in friendships, but love, relationships, and kids bringing the distraction in your home, permanently, reproducing and multiplying it and giving it names, all things that make one ineffective, cost time. So start avoiding people, feel cold, sad, and dead inside; and whenever you are doubting, compare what the introvert vs extrovert forever achieving score lists brings in comparison, all science and technical evolution that is human history vs all BS, war, extremism, tradition, all evil isms. Doesn´t an empty, lonely life seem a small price for helping primate progress? Don´t forget thanking me for ruining your socialization with these stupid tips, lol.<br /> <br />But seriously, social life is another prime example of habit, one becomes the people she/ he is in regular contact with and attracts more of these people, a dynamic one should not underestimate, and they all feed on you lifetime by craving for your attention, just compare how much one can get from articles and books in comparison to real life drivel filled with small talk, redundancies, errors,..., heck even the better memorization and internalization of content by social contact can be achieved with sophisticated learning techniques. To continue the isolationist standpoint (joke), it´s of course meanwhile absolutely unnecessary to make anything face to face and not in home office, VR, AR, psi transfer remote perception,... the technological singularity in general makes it more and more useless to leave the home castle.<br /> <br />A wiki walk can be as refreshing to the mind as a walk through nature in this completely overrated real life outside books: <br /><a target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_psychology"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positiv...</a><br /><a target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivation"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivation</a><br /><a target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior_modification"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavio...</a><br /><a target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_conditioning"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classic...</a><br /><a target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_development"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persona...</a><br /><a target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindfulness"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindful...</a>",4
"Why do I keep doing this to myself? All I want is a productive little audiobook to listen to while I work, helpfully filled with tips to improve my life. All I get is priviledged white people recycling the same old advice over and over. This book is especially grating as it's filled with cute little platitudes like ""the same boiling water will soften a potato and harden an egg"". I already know how boiling water works, thanks, can we get to the part where you tell me something I haven't heard from seven other productivity books already?<br /><br />At one point Clear writes, ""I get my assistant to do this for me every week, but if you don't have an assistant..."" <br /><br />I love how some of these productivity authors neglect to mention all the outside help they hire. It's like that other woman who suggested hiring an au pair for when your primary nanny is taking her vacation days. He also suggests doing things like paying for grocery delivery instead of going to the store to save time. He tells the story of one guy who paid his personal trainer $500 every time he forgot to log his food for the day.<br /><br />The real productivity hack seems to be to hire someone to do all the little day-to-day tasks for you so you can focus on other things. This is great if you're fabulously rich, but, if you're like me and don't currently have a full time assistant, and people to do your housework and your meal prep for you, then you may have to look elsewhere for more practical advice.

"This book just climbed to the top as my most favourite self-help non-fiction of the year!<br /><br />Totally engaging and quite convincing in how the book makes you want to change your bad habits and adopt good ones, this book doesn't talk in a way to make you feel overwhelmed or make you feel like everything you do is wrong or inadequate. <br /><br />The book doesn't give you impractical tips yet it tells stories and what to learn in how to gradually maintain habits that would benefit you in the long run as well as how to start maintaining habits that you have been wanting to in small practical steps. <br /><br />This book is life-changing for me.<br /><br />I have already adopted some of these tips yet the book makes me realise that there are many things that we do that we consider harmless yet taking up most of our time which make us frustrated in real. <br /><br />The tips are easy to understand and follow. The writing is amazing. I would highly recommend this book.<br /><br />This one is already changing my year and the rest of everything else that's going to happen in how I make my future a better and a fulfilling one.<br /><br /><br />Too good to be true. Literally life changing 🍂",5
"There are many self-help books discussing the topics of habit. Some of them are written by famous authors like Stephen R. Covey, Charles Duhigg, and Timothy Ferris. <br /><br />I read this book after reading the books by the above authors and was sure that I won't get any new information. Despite discussing a similar topic, James Clear managed to pull a convincing book discussing these familiar ideas in a new way that will help us view our daily routine and life differently and will be a good choice if you are interested in the topic of productivity. <br /><br /><br />—————————————————————————<br /><b>

"I received this book as a Goodreads giveaway yesterday and immediately settled down to read it. I am always very skeptical of self help books because they often do no get to the root of issues. This one did. James Clear's main arguments are that habits are the compound interest of self improvement and that your identify emerges out of your habits. So, you must expereince a shift in identity for your habits to hold. This made a lot of sense to me, but I do think that Clear should have addresses deeper emotional issues and gave readers resources so as not to mislead them into believing that they can change their identity by action (repeating new habits) alone.

"I am in the mood for more non fiction lately, so I decided to read the books of Ali's book club. I wanted to read a book on habits for a long time now and Atomic Habits met all those criteria.<br /><br />I am not gonna elaborate a lot since it is a well known book and there are a lot of YouTube videos that summed it up better than I can ever do including Abdaal's video here:<br /><br /> <a href=""https://youtu.be/YT7tQzmGRLA"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Check Video</a><br /><br />Like all non-fiction books, I found most of the information in the book to be logical but the way it was written and ordered was pretty good. I found it engaging, easy to read and scientific. I enjoy it when authors provide data through real life stories and there was a lot of that here.<br /><br />The book mostly discusses 4 laws to get into a habit or get out of one. These are: Make it Obvious, Make it Attractive, Make it Easy, Make it Satisfying. And if you inverse those you get a way to lose bad habits. A very intriguing read!",4
"<b>“Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become. No single instance will transform your beliefs, but as the votes build up, so does the evidence of your new identity.”</b><br /><br />I’ve been trying so hard lately to break out of a funk and every self-help book I read recommends starting at the most basic level. We must sort out our daily habits before we can begin to feel better and more fulfilled in our lives. But how do we do this? <br /><br />Gradual change is the answer. If we improve each day by just 1% by the end of the year we will be dramatically and unrecognizably better. Winning tiny battles will determine our future self. Identifying bad habits that are ruining our potential is the key to change. We must eradicate them, slowly, if need be, and replace them with habits that allow us to grow each day. We must set goals and work towards them in a sensible and patient fashion.<br /><br /><b>“You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.”</b><br /><br />We also need to design a system to achieve our goals. Simply having goals is not enough. We need to have an actionable framework on how we can move towards these otherwise we will never reach them. We must have a process to follow and daily habits that allow us to achieve them. Our level of commitment to the process will determine our level of progress. Sticking to healthy proactive habits with our end goals in mind is the key. <br /><br />So, here’s a little bit about me and my goals for this year: I want to complete a 100-mile ultra-marathon and I also want to have written up a full draft of my PhD. How will I achieve these goals? Habitually running and writing each day, habitually working towards them and remaining committed to the process of daily improvement. I will also read everyday and review on Goodreads more frequently because it helps me remain focused on the process. Daily writing is so important for me as is learning and discovering more literature. <br /><br />I quite enjoyed this. It proposes a very straightforward approach to being successful and one I am very keen to implement into my own life.

"<b> <i> ""Success is the product of daily habits—not once-in-a-lifetime transformations."" </i></b> <br /><br />Goals are useful for charting a course, but systems are the most effective in moving forward. When you spend too much time thinking about your goals and not enough time creating your systems, you'll run into a few issues. The antidote is a systems-first mentality. When you fall in love with the process rather than the product, you don’t have to wait to permit yourself to be happy. You can be satisfied anytime your system is running.<br /><i><br />My 3 major takeaways from this  book are:<br /><br />1. An atomic habit is a regular practice or routine that is small and easy to do and is also the source of incredible power; a component of the system of compound growth.<br />2. Bad habits repeat themselves again and again not because you don’t want to change, but because you have the wrong system for change.<br />3. Changes that seem small and unimportant at first will compound into remarkable results if you’re willing to stick with them for years.<br /></i><br />Highly recommended to understand the science behind habit building and practically implement those baby steps to build or break a habit.<br /><br />Grab your copy <a href=""https://amzn.to/3gWE36j"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">here</a> or <a href=""https://amzn.to/45BOa4d"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">here.</a>",5
"DNF at 45% I don't even want to waste any more time on this book with a full review. Here's a quick rundown of why I hated it:<br />Ableism throughout<br />Bootstrap mentality <br />Fatphobia throughout<br />Condescending, patronizing tone from the author (even, or maybe especially, on the audio version.) <br />I could go on...<br /><br />This book had some valid, common sense points, but its flaws far overshadowed any redeeming qualities. Just...nope.",1
"Well, there’s almost no single shred of original content here. It could be a fine book if it’s the first self-improvement book you have started to read. <br /><br />The science is also flawed. He presents the following elements for habit:<br />1. Cue<br />2. Craving<br />3. Action<br />4. Reward<br /> Not to mention that its a skewed copy of principles presented in Power of Habits (to authors credit, he mentions it), craving starts to appear strongly only when your brain has learned to associate the cue, action, reward which happens with repetition. <br /><br />Two star is a good score. It was merely okay. Given the earth-shattering noise it had made, I simply expected more. <br />",2
"The book was overwhelmingly male-centric. Most of the examples he put forward (other than ballet dancer Twyla Tharp and doctor Anne Thorndike), were about male stockbrokers, scientists, businessmen, sports figures (Michael Phelps, Magic Johnson) and comedians (Steve Martin, Chris Rock). Where are the successful women? Also, it was more about using habits to be ""successful"" in a traditional sense, by making your way to the top of the corporate ladder or excelling in whatever you do, being fit or elite or whatever, instead of improving relationships, decision making, work/life balance, or overall, just being a good person. <br /><br />Funny, I was highlighting a bunch of material (a signal that I was full of hope!) in the first chapter, then it abruptly stopped, and I never highlighted another item in the whole book. The last thing I noted was on page 33, where some guy/entrepreneur says, ""I asked my wife to schedule my first-ever manicure. My thought was that if I started paying to maintain my nails, I wouldn't chew them. And it worked, but not for the monetary reason. What happened was the manicure made my fingers look really nice for the first time.... Suddenly, I was so proud of my fingernails."" Here, I wrote, ""WTF?"" Sorry, but a statement like this reeks of privilege and frankly, makes me want to puke. I am concerned about his wife, and I can't believe it got past the editors. Was this written in 2018 or 1988? In retrospect, this was the moment I should have abandoned the book and opted for something more relevant to my life. <br /><br />Another problem I have with this book.... he talks much, in the beginning of the book, about identity change. ""The goal isn't to read the book, it's to become a reader."" Or ""The goal is not to run a marathon, it's to become a runner...""  Then in the last chapter, in his ""downsides to habit change"" he discusses how identity can hold you back. The key is to ""keep your identity small,"" (some investor guy says) because your identity will change as your role changes (or with age). So, ""I'm an athlete"" becomes ""I'm a person who is mentally tough and loves a challenge."" ""I'm a soldier"" becomes ""I'm the type of person who is disciplined, reliable and great on a team."" ""I'm the CEO"" translates to ""I'm the type of person who builds and creates things."" So, the message is to have a flexible identity. I actually think this is key information that provides a healthy balance in life, and belongs right up there in chapter 1 with all the other information about identity. Rather, it's an afterthought at the very end of the book. And it's contradictory. Also, where is the ""I'm a good listener. I'm there for my kids. I make time to help others. I'm a good friend."" Are all habits so.... macho and self-centered? Maybe I missed the point, or maybe it was just the wrong book for me. <br /><br />That said, I did pull some good information from chapter 13, the two-minute rule/habit shaping. When I opened it to this chapter in the book store where I bought it, I was intrigued. I thought this type of information could help me with my 2021 goals (which have been blown to bits). But I found it the most helpful chapter in the book, overall. I can use the ""art of showing up"" and the concept of not being consumed by the end goal in my life. <br /><br />I learned: If you're a woman and you're looking for a book on habit change, pick up a book written by a woman; preferably one who has done her research and with whom you have something in common.",2
"<i>Atomic Habits: An Easy &amp; Proven Way to Build Good Habits &amp; Break Bad Ones</i> is a practical framework for how to build <i>and keep</i> new habits. To create a good habit, author James Clear suggests: <br /><br /> - Make it Obvious<br /> - Make it Attractive<br /> - Make it Easy<br /> - Make it Satisfying<br /><br />While at first glance these may seem overly simplistic, <i>Atomic Habits</i> delves into each of these concepts and also describes how these same ideas can be inverted to break bad habits. The content is easily digestible. <br /><br />Different parts are likely to resonate with different readers but I found a lot of helpful information in this book, especially in one of the final chapters about how to stay motivated — Mastery requires practice. <i>”The only way to become excellent is to become endlessly fascinated with doing the same thing over and over. You have to fall in love with boredom.”</i><br /><br /><i>Atomic Habits</i> is a read I recommend for anyone trying to step up their game, in any facet of life, with the reminder that refinement and improvement are continuous, long-term processes.",4
"This is a dual review of two books about habit. Habits are important things in one’s life and there are numerous books on the subject. The classic book, a must read, is The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People by Stephen R. Covey. Another two popular books about habits are The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg and Atomic Habits by James Clear, that came out very recently. Having read all three of them I combined my notes for the last two in this post. No matter what stage in life you are, it is always good to review one’s habits and behaviour – these books provide a good framework for doing it.<br /><br />One of the habits I’m struggling with is to get rid of the reading of self-help books. Thus, reading The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg and parallelly Atomic Habits by James Clear became a sort of a meta enterprise. Would these self-help books about habits help me to get rid of the habit of reading self-help books? There’s nothing wrong with the self-help genre per se. I believe, everybody should strive to become a better version of themselves. Evidently, there’s a lot of great wisdom in this type of books – many prominent figured refer to them when they tell the story of their success. However, having read tons of them, one would usually circle around the same known stuff and shabby ideas wrapped in different narratives and supported by different anecdotes. The trick here is to know when to stop and, actually, go out and do something by using the knowledge and inspiration gained.<br /><br />My own habit of falling back to self-help books is, obviously, grounded in the alluring products of the habit loop driven by the craving for knowledge on self-improvement. We can use the basic members of the habit loop – cue, routine, and reward – well covered in the Duhigg’s book and analyse the situation with the reading of self-help books. For this type of products, the cues (triggers) are everywhere, and who can ignore the wish for excellence? Then, the routine is easily carried out – the messages in those books are straightforward that doesn’t require a very deep thinking and reading between the lines. It just assumes the acceptance in many cases, and, finally, the reward is instant – the feeling of getting something very valuable – a digested wisdom and not seldom a bit of inspiration. It can be compared to junk food (which by the way is almost gone from my life thanks to this kind of books). However, my point is not to pick on this genre, but rather to stress the importance of not getting stuck in it, as in my previous point. <br /><br />Habit as a phenomena humans and other living creatures are equipped with is one of my favourite subjects. I strongly believe, in the end, habits defines us and our destiny. The subject of habit covers several interesting areas as neuroscience, biology, psychology, and more. The basic mechanics of habit system can be described through the theory of operand conditioning, a term coined by B.F. Skinner back in 1930. It is a technique of learning that occurs through reward and punishment for behaviour. Through operand conditioning, an individual makes an association between a behaviour and a consequence. A relatively simple feedback loop forming habits of an individual can be described in terms of drive, stimulus, response, reward with different kind of reinforcers – positive or negative. <br /><br />What was lacking in the model of operand conditioning was other influencers like feelings, thoughts, and, very importantly – beliefs. Moreover, human behaviour is so complex that factors as the environment and group psychology are of crucial importance when it comes to the habit science. Modern behavioural science takes these terms into account and they are very important in the habit theory. The authors of both books did a great job addressing these factors in their respective methodologies.<br /><br />Based on the early theory of operand conditioning, different models around habits and behaviour (in my interpretation, behaviour is a series of actions evoked by habits) are developed and fundamental terms are just called different names. Charles Duhigg in The Power of Habit grounds his model on the habit loop consisting of cue-routine-reward parameters which are driven by craving. James Clear in Atomic Habits suggests his model consisting of four steps called cue, craving, response, and reward. These factors are systematically analysed by respective author and the steps how to build good habits and remove the bad ones based on these models are suggested. In both books I found some valuable and interesting points as well as good tips on how to keep one’s habits on the right track.<br /><br />As one can see from the parameters in each model, there’s a difference in the arrangement of them making some differences in application of the methodologies of habit treatment. Duhigg sees the term craving as a driving force for the members in the habit loop – cue, routine, reward. Clear suggests that craving is simply a second stage in his model of habit. This is the main difference, and I need to admit I haven’t put enough time to analyse which model is right – both make sense. We would need some deeper diving in relevant disciplines and get help from ontology of the actual things here. Anyhow, I tend to believe that a craving lies above cue, routine, and reward. Cues alone without craving are meaningless. Nevertheless, both models are very useful for working on one’s habits. Duhigg argues that the way of changing or replacing of habit is to focus on the routine parameter, or the response part according to the terminology or Clear. Clear gives a lot of examples on how the cue and reward steps can be worked on. I completely agree that even these parts can be influenced, whereas Duhigg argues that the most important thing is to focus on routine leaving cues and rewards unchanged. I believe, we can remove unwanted triggers. Like making the tempting things like candies hard to reach and out of sight, etc. This has been well researched in a very interesting work by Richard H. Thaler for which he was awarded the Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel 2017. Then, we can reprogram our brain to think about rewards differently – change the mode of them or reinforce the distant rewards requiring immediate sacrifice by some direct reward. Clear has a lot of good examples how to do it.<br /><br />Habit should be seen as one of the essential parts forming an individual. A brilliant quote by Margaret Thatcher shows the operational importance of habits: “Watch your thoughts, for they will become actions. Watch your actions, for they'll become... habits. Watch your habits for they will forge your character. Watch your character, for it will make your destiny.” If we put those terms it in a different order, we can see that habits are very important, perhaps more important than one’s thoughts, because they are operational tools defining which actions one will take and what destiny those actions will form.<br /><br />In summary, if you are somehow unsatisfied with any of your habits and would like to actively and effectively change them and thus become an individual you’d like to be, I strongly recommend both books. I would read The Power of Habit book first, this book is longer, has more stories, and has more research behind it. Atomic Habits book is easier to get through, especially after reading Duhigg’s book. Both books, as you might have guessed, are clear, easy to read and grasp. They will give you the right mindset to approach your behaviour and provide valuable tools to shape your personality.",4
"I really enjoyed how easily digested this book was. We all have certain habits we want to learn or unlearn and we usually start strong but lack the motivation to stick to it. This book really expanded my mind about what it actually takes to make habits stick and how motivation has VERY little to do with it. <br />I added a few of key quotes from the book that touch on some of the steps: why the smallest habits matter, awareness, repetition over perfection, focus on environment, how to keep going when the initial flame of motivation dies down, learn / unlearn your identity, pay attention to the words you use. #vlbookclub",5

Enough said.</b><br><br>People told me that when you’re starting <i>Malazan Book of the Fallen</i>, it’s mandatory to read at least two or three books in the series before finally deciding on giving up on the series. One of the main reasons behind this is that <i>Deadhouse Gates</i> is considered one of the strongest installment within the series by the fans after <i>Memories of Ice</i> and <i>The Bonehunters</i>. Now that I’ve read <i>Deadhouse Gates</i>, I finally understand why people insist newcomers on continuing to the second book first. However, please do check your expectation. Despite how much I loved this installment, I’m actually slightly disappointed with how it turns out; more detail on this further down below. <br><br><b>Picture: <i>Deadhouse Gates</i> by Marc Simonetti</b><br><br><img src=""https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1533567505i/26085536._SY540_.jpg"" width=""400"" class=""gr-hostedUserImg"" loading=""lazy""><br><br><i>Deadhouse Gates</i> is the second book in <i>The Malazan Book of the Fallen</i> series. Unlike your typical sequel, this felt more like a standalone sequel featuring almost a completely new set of characters in a totally different continent with a brand new self-contained main story. The story of the book revolves around the rebellion in the Seven Cities; the setting of the first book was in Genabackis. Although this installment felt denser to read—it also has 70k more words—and arguably more complex than <i>Gardens of the Moon</i>, in my opinion, the narrative was more unputdownable than its predecessor. Erikson sang his dark chorus to color the tone of the book with a bleakly crimson tone; his melody of doom never ceases to expand. If you’re in the mood for a hopeful book, this isn’t the time for you to read this one. <i>Deadhouse Gates</i> is a much darker book in every possible way compared to <i>Gardens of the Moon</i>. I honestly feel like this book can be described as a gradual descent into palpable despair and madness.<br><br><b>

    <blockquote>“Children are dying.""<br>Lull nodded. ""That's a succinct summary of humankind, I'd say. Who needs tomes and volumes of history? Children are dying. The injustices of the world hide in those three words.”</blockquote>
  </i>
</b><br><br>My experience of reading this book—especially on reread—was much better than reading its predecessor; I loved it. In <i>Gardens of the Moon</i>, I felt invested only in a few of the characters, but Erikson has delivered what I wanted with the characterizations here. The characterizations were superb; they felt more fleshed out, and their dialogues were great. Although almost all the characters featured in <i>Deadhouse Gates</i> are new—with only a few characters from the first book being featured—to the series, but the new characters—whether you love or hate them—were so damn engaging and compelling to read. We have Icarium and Mappo’s friendship, the complex Felisin, and the best of them all, Duiker’s storyline. Duiker’s POV chapters were easily the best part of the book for me, and anyone who has read this book will definitely know why. Spectacular character developments aside, it was because of the new character inclusion: Coltaine. Without spoiling anything for you, all I can say is that there’s no way you won’t be inspired by Coltaine’s actions. It is very intriguing to me that Coltaine, like Anomander Rake, didn’t even have a POV chapter, and yet he managed to completely steal the spotlight. For the majority of the time, we followed Coltaine’s journey through Duiker’s perspectives, and you know what? That’s totally okay with me. Similar to Duiker and Coltaine’s soldiers, I’m content with being left in awe and astonished at the superhuman feat he’s doing with his Chain of Dogs. The gradual loyalty and respect he achieved through his actions were unforgettable. Actions speak louder than words, and Coltaine proved that elevenfold.<br> <br><b>

    <blockquote>“It is one thing to lead by example with half a dozen soldiers at your back. It is wholly another with ten thousand.”</blockquote>
  </i>
</b><br><br>I’ve mentioned in my <i>Gardens of the Moon</i> review that the climax sequences felt anti-climactic, especially after having such an epic scope to the overall book. However, by Hood’s gates, Erikson’s battle sequences in <i>Deadhouse Gates</i> were bloody awesome and intricately written. Erikson hasn’t shown his capability to write close-quarter combats yet, but when it comes to grand and epic scopes confrontations, he’s top-notch at it. The rain of mayhem, the vivid bloody carnage; it felt like watching an inevitable avalanche happening in real-time. I’m just utterly amazed by the maelstrom of sorcery and the calamity that occurred.<br><br>Honestly speaking, I had one minor issue with the book, a few plotlines in the book that involved ships were sluggish for me to get through. However, the main reason why I didn't enjoy this installment as much as I hoped was due to being spoiled. Fans of the series constantly told me that there was one powerful scene in <i>Deadhouse Gates</i> that will break my heart and soul; this didn’t happen to me because I’ve been spoiled on the event itself in detail, MULTIPLE times. Not only that, but it also distracted my reading experience because I can’t stop thinking about the event itself. Thank you to the “extremely knowledgeable fans” for spoiling me even though I didn’t ask any questions. Some Malazan fanatics seriously deserves an award for being the biggest assholes; they lived up to their reputation for shoving their Malazan knowledge down people’s throat without people asking. “Oh, you didn’t ask for spoilers? I’ll still force it down your throat, boy.” Let me say this, I absolutely don’t care about your understanding or knowledge of any series if you’re going to spoil my reading experience. I’ve mentioned this countless times, spoilers have the potential to ruin a reader’s experience. For newcomers to this series, I suggest that every time you see the word Malazan in any kind of discussion, immediately scroll through them. Trust me, most of the time, there will be unasked and unmarked spoilers. Also, DO NOT CHECK the cover art for <i>Deadhouse Gates</i> Subterranean Edition or the Spanish edition. The art director was so ignorant of spoilers that they decided to make sure the cover depicts the most impactful and the biggest event of the book. Genius.<br><br><b>

    <blockquote>“The lesson of history is that no one learns.”</blockquote>
  </i>
</b><br><br>Overall, though, despite my rant on some of the fanatics of the series, I do have to give the benefit of the doubt to Steven Erikson because even though my reading experience was downgraded due to spoilers, the content of the book was hauntingly vivid, brutal, and memorable. <i>Deadhouse Gates</i> is a truly stunning and bloodily bleak sequel. Erikson didn’t hold back with his punches, and I envisioned any newcomer to this book will definitely feel heart-wrenched and mesmerized. I will continue immediately to <i>Memories of Ice</i>, a book that’s been acclaimed by the fans as the best or the second-best installment of the series, and I certainly hope I’ll feel the same about it.<br><br><b>You can order the book <u><a href=""http://www.bookdepository.com/book/%209780765314291/?a_aid=petrikleo"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">HERE!</a></u></b><br><br><i>You can find <b><u><a href=""http://novelnotions.net/2018/08/06/deadhouse-gates-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-2/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">this</a></u></b> and the rest of my reviews at <b><u><a href=""http://novelnotions.net"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Novel Notions</a></u></b></i><br><br><i>Special thanks to my Patrons on <b><u><a href=""https://www.patreon.com/petrikleo"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Patreon</a></u></b> for giving me extra support towards my passion for reading and reviewing!<br><br>My Patrons: Alfred, Alya, Annabeth, Ben, Blaise, Devin, Diana, Edward, Hamad, Helen, Jimmy Nutts, Joie, Lufi, Melinda, Mike, Miracle, Nicholas, Seth, Shaad, Summer, Zoe.</i>",4

"<b>A book that is epic in both scope and narrative - but for me a book where the payoff of the destination, was not quite worth the effort of the journey....</b><br><br><b>Final Rating: 3.6/5</b> 🌕🌕🌕🌗🌑<br><br>I wanted to love this, but overall it was a step down for me from The Gardens of the Moon. While they were both equally complex, I felt that there just wasn't as much of an epic ending in this book as there was in the first. Indeed, when people speak of the ""epic ending"" in this book I'm still not actually sure which part or storyline they're referring to. Which is never a good sign. That said, I'm still very keen to continue with the series and am just hoping that the next book in the series finally ""clicks"" for me :)<br><br><img src=""https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1685322063i/34299522._SY540_.jpg"" class=""gr-hostedUserImg"" loading=""lazy""><br><b>Coltaine</b><br><br><b>Plot Summary</b><br>""Deadhouse Gates"", the second book in the Malazan Book of the Fallen series, shifts the action to the continent of Seven Cities, on the brink of a holy rebellion known as the Whirlwind. The plot follows multiple characters, such as Felisin, a young noblewoman sold into slavery, and Kalam, an assassin with plans to kill the Empress. Among the most memorable plotlines is the journey of Coltaine, a Malazan commander guiding a host of refugees through hostile desert lands. The narrative balances numerous threads, diving deep into the rich history, culture, and magic of the Malazan world, culminating in a complex tale of survival and sacrifice.<br><br><b>
  <i>““Children are dying.""<br>Lull nodded. ""That's a succinct summary of humankind, I'd say. Who needs tomes and volumes of history? Children are dying. The injustices of the world hide in those three words.””</i>
</b><br><br><b>Storyline: 2.5/5</b><br>When it comes to narrative, ""Deadhouse Gates"" is no doubt an epic. Erikson spins a yarn filled with countless characters, vast landscapes, and intertwining plotlines. Each storyline carries its own weight, and when they converge, the result can be pretty awe-inspiring. The Chain of Dogs plotline, for instance, is an emotional rollercoaster, a tale of courage and sacrifice that stands out amidst the narrative tapestry.<br><br>However, in this instance I found that the complexity of the narrative was a bit too much to handle. There are so many (new) characters and plots to follow that it feels like you're navigating a maze without a map. Erikson certainly doesn't coddle his readers; he expects you to piece it all together yourself. While some might appreciate this approach, I found it a bit overwhelming (even with the help of a readers guide). It often felt more like work than enjoyment to keep up with all the details and connect the dots.<br><br>I normally don't mind work in a fantasy book, indeed I kind of expect it as you get the world built out before you, so that it all culminates is some epic payoff. Seeing all those scattered puzzle pieces finally come together, witnessing the evolution of characters, and experiencing the climax of each storyline can be satisfying. But, at least for me, this book got that calculation off by a wide margin. The effort required to reach that payoff was just a too steep. And the narrative while there is certainly a narrative payoff, no doubt, the reward didn't make up for the complexity of the climb. I remember saying to myself through the first 600 pages, it'll be worth it in the end just keep going. Then in the final 200 I kept asking, when is the payoff going to get here? Then in the last 50, I realised that the small narrative climax I'd just passed was not a false peak, it was the actual peak (""Was that the AMAZING ending people that people kept telling me about?""). So in terms of scope, it's a narrative marvel for sure, but I couldn't shake off the feeling that a more accessible path to the payoff (or a epic ending similar to Gardens of the Moon) would have made the experience more enjoyable.<br><br><b>
  <i>“The lesson of history is that no one learns.”</i>
</b><br><br><b>Characterisation: 3.5/5</b><br>I'm in two minds about characterisation in this book. The first part of me thinks that the characters in ""Deadhouse Gates"" are really out of this world in terms of how they're written - although many of them are very unlikeable. The second part of me though really disliked how we didn't get to follow on with the stories of characters from the first book, because Erikson decided to start a whole new slate of story lines. I think I get why he did it (and that he'll continue to do it throughout this series), but chopping and changing like that really isn't my cup of tea. <br><br>If I just look at the characters in ""Deadhouse Gates"" though, they truly are something else. Erikson rolls out a whole new cast, each with their own unique backstory and motivations. You've got characters like Fiddler, whose quiet determination just grabs you, and Felisin, whose heartbreaking transformation hits you right in the feels. Then there's my favorite, Kalam - he's this enigmatic, deadly assassin but with such a depth of character, he feels real. He's got this tough exterior, but underneath, there's a sense of loyalty and a quest for justice that makes you root for him. Even characters like Coltaine, who could've been just another tough, distant military guy, are way more layered and interesting than you'd expect. Erikson's characters might not all be likable, but wow, do they pull you into their stories. They bring this epic tale down to earth, making it personal. So, they're not just characters in a fantasy book; they feel like real people trying to make it through a seriously brutal world.<br><img src=""https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1685322063i/34299521._SX540_.jpg"" class=""gr-hostedUserImg"" loading=""lazy""><br><b>Kalam Mekhar</b><br><br><i>
  <b>“What makes a Malazan soldier so dangerous? They’re allowed to think”</b>
</i><br><br><b>Writing Style: 4/5</b><br>Erikson's prose continues to be a standout. It's dense, lyrical, and often philosophical, offering profound insights into the nature of power, war, and human nature. His world-building is second to none, effortlessly combining elements of fantasy, history, and anthropology to create a unique and immersive universe.<br><br>Despite these strengths, the pacing can be uneven. Some storylines move at a brisk pace, while others seem to drag. The book also tends to lean heavily into grimdark territory, which may not be to everyone's taste. While I personally don't mind it, I'm sure some readers would also find the relentless brutality and cynicism exhausting - it certainly feels like the narrative is wallowing in its own misery sometimes.<br><br><b>
  <i>“We are all lone souls. It pays to know humility, lest the delusion of control, of mastery, overwhelms. And, indeed, we seem a species prone to that delusion, again and ever again.”</i>
</b><br><br><b>World Building: 5/5</b><br>Now, let's talk about the world-building in ""Deadhouse Gates"". Man, is it something to behold. Erikson doesn't just create a world; he constructs an entire universe, overflowing with rich history, diverse cultures, and mystical elements that blow your mind. This book whisks us away from the familiar setting of the first installment and drops us onto a whole new continent with its own unique problems and tensions. It's like stepping into a whole new world within an already massive one. The attention to detail is crazy—you've got distinct societies, religions, even different systems of magic. But what really gets me is how Erikson weaves all these intricate details together to create a world that feels alive, chaotic, and just as messed up as our own.<br><br><b>
  <i>“It is one thing to lead by example with half a dozen soldiers at your back. It is wholly another with ten thousand.”</i>
</b><br><br><b>Enjoyment: 3/5 </b><br>There's no denying that it's an impressive book. Erikson's creativity and the sheer magnitude of his world-building had me marveling at the page. Characters like Kalam, who became my favorite, and the memorable Chain of Dogs storyline, added an engaging depth to the narrative. It's a rollercoaster of a read with moments of genuine awe and heartache. But, it's also a tricky beast. The complexity, while impressive, often felt overwhelming, pulling me out of the story just when I was starting to get into it. I found myself working harder than I'd have liked to keep track of everything. So while there were parts I really enjoyed, the effort required to fully appreciate this intricate tapestry took a toll on my overall enjoyment. It's a book that's rewarding to those willing to commit, but be prepared for the hefty challenge it presents. All said, ""Deadhouse Gates"" is an intriguing but demanding read that delivers a satisfying payoff, even if getting there can be a bit of a slog.<br><br>I'll definitely continue with the series, but I'm hoping that the next book (which appears to be the highest rated book of the series) will at least continue with one of the existing storylines and not jump to some different third continent. <br><br><b>Final Rating: 3.6/5</b> 🌕🌕🌕🌕🌗<br><br><b>

  </b>
</blockquote><br /><br />If you have read <i>The Gardens of the Moon</i> you are aware that it was a complex and somewhat perplexing read, that it had a colossal set of characters and that the unraveling the yarn of story threads was a tremendous reward. <i>Deadhouse Gates</i> follows those footsteps and delivers another monumental tale, a tale that will captivate you right from the beginning and take you on an epic journey you will never forget.<br /><br />The story picks up right after the events of GotM but we are no longer on the continent of Genabackis, our journey in the Malazan world continues in the Seven Cities of the Malazan Empire.<br /><br />The Empire is on the brink of rebellion, hanging in the balance of a long prophesied war, an uprising known as Whirlwind, led by the prophetess Sha'ik from the Holy Desert of Raraku, that will free the Seven Cities of the Malazan usurpers. Malazan forces are placed under the command of the legendary Coltaine of the Crow Clan of the Wickans, a warlord who once led a rebellion against the former emperor Kellanved. Events that follow are a part of the story arc named <i>Chain of Dogs</i>.<br /><br /><i>Chain of Dogs</i> is on another level, it is so strong that it can be perceived as a book within a book. It is a powerful tale that vividly expresses all aspects of war, a tale with outstanding and unique battle sequences and aftermath which will ensure your emotional involvement. It is a capstone of <i>Deadhouse Gates</i> that thrives in delivering scenes of astonishing power and stunning imagery. <br /><br />Meanwhile, familiar characters from the GotM along with a couple of new faces are on a personal quest of their own, providing more depth to the story and giving a wider scope to the plot whilst moving it forward. Storylines are interwoven in a rich tapestry of seemingly diverse threads, laid before us at the end of the book, as a sight to behold.<br /> <br />The immense detail of Erikson's world-building is sublime; history, culture, religion, artefacts, ruins and atmosphere are all equally represented elements of an intricate painting that is forming in our mind as we read along. <br /><br />Erikson’s writing and humanizing of characters provokes a full spectrum of emotions. Characters are exceptionally written and they are the beating heart of this book, a heart that will synchronize with yours and form a strong, emotional bond which will affect your state of mind. <br /><br />This is book is going to take a special place on my favorites shelf, and I will, of course, continue to immerse myself in the epic world of Malazan.<br /><br /><blockquote>

"<b>*** 5+ ***<br /><br />A second read with the FBR gang!<br /><br /><i>“Children are dying.""<br />Lull nodded. ""That's a succinct summary of humankind, I'd say. Who needs tomes and volumes of history? Children are dying. The injustices of the world hide in those three words.”</i></b><br /><br />Second time around and although I knew what was going to happen, this time I had more emotional fortitude to catch all the little details without freaking out about the action... Strongly recommend this series to everyone!!!<br /><br /><b>*** 5 ***<br /><br />A catch-up buddy read with the Grim-Dark Fantasy Fans @ BB&amp;B!</b><br /><br />I always write my reviews immediately after I finish reading a book, because I am not a literary reviewer, I am just a book addict who tries to save my overall​ impression of the story right away, while it is fresh in my mind. Having just finished this second installment in the Malazan Empire, I am feeling emotionally wiped out and physically exhausted... I don't believe I can do this work justice!<br /><br /><b>
  <i>""...""We are all lone souls. It pays to know humility, lest the delusion of control, of mastery, overwhelms. And indeed, we seem a species prone to that delusion, again and ever again…”...""</i>
</b><br /><br />There are countless amazing and informative reviews out there, and just as with my other favorite major Fantasy series, I will not even attempt to delve into the plot. The beauty of any Epic Fantasy is in committing yourself to follow the numerous timelines, the astounding amount of characters, and just as many plot-lines and settings, while putting together the pieces of this alien and imaginative world. A world imagined, but oh so real in the way it affects your soul! <br /><br /><b>
  <i>""...""For all that scholars tried, Duiker knew there was no explanation possible for the dark currents of human thought that roiled in the wake of bloodshed.”...""</i>
</b><br /><br />I have always thought of the Fantasy Genre as a canvas which gives you the freedom to reflect the best and worst of humanity in a way in which we can separate ourselves from the villains and try to emulate the heroes. We can see the character weaknesses and try to mold ourselves into something better... It is a genre so far away from us, but yet so close to our humanity, that it is more of a window to our core being only presented in a manner easier for us to swallow... I am well aware that <i> Deadhouse Gates</i> is a Grim-Dark Fantasy and not much is usually expected from the genre apart from blood, guts, and a ton of characters dying. And we have a ton of this here, but I experienced it as much more than that... Maybe I read to much into it, but this is what I feel right now.<br /><br /><b>
  <i>""...""When I said ferocity I meant a miasma of chaos. But I will grant you that terror thrives equally well in order.”...""</i>
</b><br /><br />To me, Steven Erikson, who has created this amazing world of layers of Humans, Elder and Newer G-DS, Ascendants, different Races varying in longevity and physiology, all set in drastically different continents and parallel realities with levels of Magical influence, has written an expose on the human capacity for self-destruction and inability to learn as a group from our previous experiences. Not only inability, but at times the willful ignorance of our history, which makes us victims to our worse nature in perpetuity... <br /><br /><b>
  <i>""...""Mortality’s many comforting layers had been stripped away, revealing wracked bones, a sudden comprehension of death that throbbed like an exposed nerve.”...""</i>
</b><br /><br />The devastation of war and seemingly endless feuds with enemies of long ago, the suffering of those who have no say in their Faiths, the helpless agony of the old, weak, poor, young, disadvantaged, and the seeking of even a temporary oblivion in hurtful ways are all strikingly and vividly portrayed starting with the first chapter... It sets the mood for the book until the end. Just when you think that the sustained pain and anguish have made you numb to it, the author finds more ways to strike at your heart and make you remember every dark moment of dispair you have lived through, just so you can at least partially empathize with a fraction of what the characters are going through. Although the visual effect of some of the more gruesome scenes were shocking, the moments which truly tore at my soul were the very few moments of fleeting vulnerability which were so masterfully placed in the seas of violence, that I don't believe I could ever forget them. I cried! I cried at 3 sentences which were so out of left field, that I could not even stop the tears streaming down my cheeks in order not to upset my housemates. Had to run to the bathroom and sob, wash up and give myself time to compose some semblance of normal upon my person. Having read the first book in the series, I was not prepared for the debt of emotion and substance this book had in its content. And I am grateful for every crumb of it!!!<br /><br /><b>
  <i>""...""All those tomes you’ve read, those other thoughts from other men, other women. Other times. How does a mortal make answer to what his or her kind are capable of? Does each of us, soldier or no, reach a point when all that we’ve seen, survived, changes us inside? Irrevocably changes us. What do we become, then? Less human, or more human? Human enough, or too human?”...""</i>
</b><br /><br />The other thing that really impressed me was having two Historians​ as leading characters. They were not perfect heroes, they were very much as normal as they can be under the circumstances, but boy, do their tales pack a punch! There were whole passages I wanted to quote, but it would be to much and I will encourage everyone who is a fan of Fantasy, Adventure or Military Fiction to find the time to devote to this series and discover it for themselves! It is very dense in prose so it needs some more concentration, but it is totally worth it!!! I can't wait to delve into the next book right away 🙂<br /><br /><b>
  <i>""...""Such are memories in full flood. We are not simple creatures. You dream that with memories will come knowledge, and from knowledge, understanding. But for every answer you find, a thousand new questions arise. All that we were has led us to where we are, but tells us little of where we’re going. Memories are a weight you can never shrug off....""</i>
</b><br /><br />Now I wish you all Happy Reading and may you always find what you need in the pages of a good book!!!",5
"For those who have read <i>Gardens of the Moon</i> and thought it was relatively tame for a grimdark fantasy series, <i>Deadhouse Gates</i> will change your mind. This sequel took the series to new heights and was also when I begun to wholly understand Erikson's opening quote in the debut. The grimness, violence and brutality in this book made me rethink of how I viewed <i>A Song of Ice and Fire</i>. <br><br>The events at the end of <i>Gardens of the Moon</i> saw the Bridgeburners splitting up, with the bulk of squad remaining on Genabackis with Dujek Onearm and Whiskeyjack to face the threat of the Pannion Domin. Meanwhile Fiddler and Kalam headed off to Seven Cities, where the Bridgeburners were forged, and which is on the brink of rebellion as the Seventh Year of Dryjhna, the Apocalypse, approaches. When the Book of Dryjhna is delivered into the hands of the Sha'ik, the spirit of the goddess will embody this prophetess and the Whirlwind together with the rebellion will rise. <br><br>Seven Cities portray a landscape of bleakness and despair that seem to seep into the very bones of this ancient civilization. Bones buried so deep and underneath so many layers of cities on top of cities that its very air evoked antiquity and the scent of a bloody history. Amidst this desolate backdrop, and echoing its refrain of grief, loss and regret were five different storylines moving in tandem across this sub-continent as well as the Holy Desert of Raraku. Two of these arcs eventually coincided with the endgame of reaching a gate where the convergence of a host of dangerous shapeshifters was taking place at the same time. <br><br>The subplots in <i>Gardens of the Moon</i> appear almost simplistic in comparison to <i>Deadhouse Gates</i>. Fortunately, the writing in this instalment was tighter that in spite of its numerous arcs the narrative was discernibly better and somehow flows more naturally between the different points of view. And while we have the familiar faces of Fiddler, Kalam, Crokus and Apsalar (formerly known as Sorry), we were once more introduced to a substantial number of new characters right from the Prologue. I will refrain from detailing every single subplot or new fascinating characters but instead highlight the ones which made this book so incredible for me. <br><br><i>
  <b>
    <blockquote>Icarium, oh, dear friend, I can tell you nothing. My curse is silence to your every question, and the hand I offer as a brother will lead you only into deceit. In love's name, I do this, at my own cost... and such a cost.</blockquote>
  </b>
</i> <br>The compassionate tale of Mappo and Icarium was one of unbending love and friendship that grew and solidified from a duty set upon the shoulders of the young Trell over a millennia ago. A duty that now seeks to protect a dear friend who is loved as a brother, from the very thing that he has been seeking for thousands of years; cataclysmic lost memories which may well be the undoing of this gentle and wise half-Jhag. Thus it was the search of such knowledge that brought this legendary pair to seek the gate located within the Holy Desert. The ferocity of Mappo's appearance belies his gentle nature and his regretful introspection was just simply heartbreaking.<br><br><i>
  <b>
    <blockquote>The Chain of Dogs. Coltaine’s Chain of Dogs. He leads, yet is led, he strains forward, yet is held back, he bares his fangs, yet what nips at his heels if not those he is sworn to protect.</blockquote>
  </b>
</i><br>I didn't use to be a fan of military plotlines but my absolute favourite arc in this book was that of the Chain of Dogs. This was told from the POV of Duiker, an ex-soldier now Imperial Historian, who followed Coltaine, war leader of the Wickan clans and newly appointed commander of the Seventh tasked to save the lives of the Malazans from the Seven Cities rebellion. Coltaine’s Seventh and his Wickan clans trudged through the bleak, hot and dry sub-continent of Seven Cities for months under relentless pursuit from the army of the Apocalypse, with an unimaginably vast winding train of Malazan refugees under their protection that just keeps growing. <br><br>Duiker, as the Imperial Historian, was meant to record and later recount the events and as such, was many times placed close to the battles’ front lines to witness the brutal and momentous clashes. His ruminations on the savagery of war and the hopelessness of Coltaine’s mission painted a very harsh, cruel and tragic view. War and death just do not discriminate. <br> <br><i>
  <b>
    <blockquote>I’ll never return to the List of the Fallen, because I see now that the unnamed soldier is a gift. The named soldier – dead, melted wax – demands a response among the living.. a response no-one can make. Names are no comfort, they’re a call to answer the unanswerable. Why did she die, not him? Why do the survivors remain anonymous – as if cursed – while the dead are revered? Why do we cling to what we lose while we ignore what we still hold?<br><br>Name none of the fallen, for they stood in our place and stand there still in each moment of our lives. Let my death hold no glory, and let me die forgotten and unknown. Let it not be said that I was one among the dead to accuse the living.</blockquote>
  </b>
</i><br>The battle scenes were superbly written with impressive military and sorcery tactics. Erikson’s writing here has a cinematic quality that created breathtaking visuals of contrasting raw beauty and gruesomeness. To top it all off, the important characters in this arc were well-written and had me irrevocably and emotionally attached. Erikson has also yet again created a charismatic character that inspired reverence, in a way similar to Anomander Rake – a leader that was enigmatic, proud, extremely capable and honourable. <br><br><b>And that is, Coltaine.</b><br> <br><img src=""https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1492526159i/22525582._SY540_.jpg"" class=""gr-hostedUserImg"" loading=""lazy""><br><br>At its core, the Chain of Dogs was a mighty tale of courage, loyalty, honour, compassion and dignity in the face of futility and hopelessness, and of betrayal of the highest order. The emotions that raged in me while reading ran the gamut from awe and empathy to utter sorrow and despair to stunned outrage and disbelief. This stupendously written storyline has a denouement that was probably among the most emotionally powerful ones I’ve ever read in any book. <br><br>With this I can say that from hereon, I’ve been ensnared by the chains of <i>Malazan Book of the Fallen</i>.<br><br><strong>You can purchase the book from <u><a href=""https://www.bookdepository.com/book/9780765348791?a_aid=petrikleo"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Book Depository (Free Shipping)</a></u>.</strong><br><br><i>You can find <a href=""https://wp.me/pa0WBY-R6"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">this</a> and my other reviews at <a href=""http://novelnotions.net/category/book-reviews/tss-reviews/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Novel Notions.</a></i>",5

"<i>""Seven Cities was an ancient civilization, steeped in the power of antiquity, where Ascendants once walked on every trader track, every lost road between forgotten places. It was said the sands hoarded power within their susurrating currents, that every stone had soaked up sorcery like blood, and that beneath every city lay the ruins of countless other cities, older cities, cities that went back to the First Empire itself. It was said each city rose on the backs of ghosts, the substance of spirits thick like layers of crushed bone; that each city forever wept beneath the streets, forever laughed, shouted, hawked wares and bartered and prayed and drew first breaths and the last breaths that announced death. Beneath the streets there were dreams, wisdom, foolishness, fears, rage, grief, lust and love and bitter hatred.""</i><br><br>The Whirlwind is rising in the Holy Desert of Raraku. In the heart of the continent of Seven Cities, Sha'ik the Seer prepares her people for the greatest and bloodiest rebellion in living memory. And the task of protecting and evacuating thirty thousand Malazan refugees falls into the hands of the Wickan warlord Coltaine, handpicked by Empress Laseen herself.<br><br><i>Deadhouse Gates</i> was in most aspects every bit as good as the first book in the series. It was a bit boring on occasion, and could probably have benefited from being significantly shorter, but all in all, it was an enjoyable book. The introduction was great, the journey to a new continent was intriguing, and the last part of the book was definitely the best part of this series so far, even if it left me as an emotional wreck.<br><br>All my favourite characters from the last book are absent in this one, but that actually proved to be a positive thing, as some of the new characters being introduced are outright amazing. Here is Duiker the old historian, a character reminiscent of the one and only Croaker (from the Chronicles of the Black Company). Here is Gesler the Malazan corporal, a mysterious soldier who just happens to be wherever the action is. Here is Iskaral Pust, a High Priest of Shadow. And Mappo and Icarium, wanderers on a search for lost memories. And last, but certainly not least, here is Coltaine, the Wickan general who leads the Seventh army in a running battle across a continent.<br><br>In addition to that solid bunch, this book also sees several key characters from the last one becoming drastically more interesting. We meet several of the Bridgeburners again, a few intriguing Ascendants are running around manipulating things, and I finally got myself a new favourite character in this series: the ruler of the Malazan Empire herself.<br><br>I had a few minor issues with this one that didn't impact my opinion of the book as a whole much, but should at least be mentioned. Firstly, it was ridiculously violent. Some of the things the rebels of Seven Cities did to men, women and children of Malazan origin were so outrageously disgusting you'll want to raze their entire continent to the ground.

"Deadhouse Gates is the second book in The Malazan Book of the Fallen series. As I neared the end of this novel, I had this realization: Steven Erikson understands epic fantasy in a unique and interesting way. To understand what I mean, let's consider a few issues. A big decision that any writer has to make involves the point-of-view character. It's important to have someone in this role who is actually going to be present at all important events, a convention which in the past has led to fictional heroes who are virtually the center of the universe--other characters may exist and earn our interest, but everything really hangs on what so-and-so does. Right back to Frodo and the ring (yes, we get into what's going on at Minas Tirith, but we know it's all for naught if Frodo doesn't succeed) and even more so in the early successors (Thomas Covenant and a succession of Shannara brats, for instance). One way to get around this limitation, common in epic fantasy today, is shifting perspectives. This is great, allowing for a larger scope without unrealistic expectations on one character being present for everything and rather more multi-polar storytelling. Erikson (and I don't mean to imply that he's the only one doing this) goes one better--not only do we have a large cast of point-of-view characters, none of them really manages to assume paramount imortance. A question like ""who's the main character"" loses meaning in The Malazan Book of the Fallen series.<br /><br />Because of this, when reading Deadhouse Gates, one might conclude that the story is basically independent of the first book in the series, Gardens of the Moon. We have some overlapping characters, but not that many or even really featured all that prominently. Probably, one could jump into the series here without having read the first book and not be all that lost. However, as the plot threads of this novel come together, it seems clear that Erikson is, in fact, weaving a truly epic tapestry in which everything interrelates, but on such a grand scale that we seem at first glance to be reading two almost-entirely-separate stories.<br /><br />Certainly, a large number of our characters from the first novel are completely ignored and a host of others introduced, but it seems clear that this is all coming together in the form of an epic fantasy of what will end up being thousands and thousands of pages, covering at least two separate continents (this impression is only reinforced by peeking ahead at the dust jacket of the next novel in the series).<br /><br />So, what do we have here? We have the tale of some renegade soldiers crossing a continent to attempt to assassinate an empress for the good of the empire; we have an uprising against the empire by a prophetess in vast desert; we have an imperial general fighting a desperate running battle for months to save imperial refugees from this uprising; we have a girl who has been betrayed by her sister in an imperial purge of the nobility, and said girl's fight for survival with her companions and her quest for vengeance against the sister who betrayed her. Beyond that are other smaller stories that weave in and out, and even some of these look tantalizingly like they could be developed at a later date (or simply add to the rich fabric of the world Erikson is weaving.<br /><br />All in all, quite a good read and I look forward to continuing this series.",5
"Phew, I did it! I finished “Deadhouse Gates”. For some time I thought I’ll never finish it :D <br><br><img src=""https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1485472999i/21818998.jpg"" class=""gr-hostedUserImg"" loading=""lazy""><br><br>So if you’re past shock as I am, we can continue :) Like GotM, this book shines with complexity. I found a multilayered story following a couple of story lines, a bunch of new characters and the famous Erikson’s style with unexpected twist, cliffhangers :) A real treat :) In fact I had a small shock as DG left almost all the characters from the first book behind in favor of a different story set on a different continent. I must confess, it was difficult sometimes to sort everything out as a lot of stuff was happening at the same time. I was definitely (and still am) surprised how lot’s of things turned out. <br><br>The storyline. <br><br>I’m not into the military stuff a lot and I’m glad that this book wasn’t soaked in it. The fighting, the battles and the various forms of fighters were great and detailed with grit and amazing Erikson’s imagination. There were times when I read page after page and thought: Oh wow, cliffhanger after cliffhanger. The storyline was more focused. There were not so many new characters, so I didn’t have to check everybody every five pages. Also the time for the story to unravel is bigger. That helped the characters and the story line. What struck me the most is that the story felt so real with interesting facts, some back stories, great flawed characters, lots of twists, action of course and cool magical aspects (I’ll name the cute deadly butterflies, a cool ghost ship, various mages and a lot more…). The story is mostly great. The last couple of chapters…..wow, it was brutal with some witty spices. If you want to know how I felt, just see the pic above :) <br><br>The peculiar thing is that the story is emotionally exhausting a bit. Sometimes I felt like after a long tiring day in an office (I had some tiring work days indeed and it annoyed me a bit ‘cause a book should ease the tension). It left me struggling to keep up. Maybe the problem I had with the book is that I read it a bit pell-mell due to my busy time. <br><br>The characters. <br><br>I liked the story mostly for the characters as I fell for most of them. Ugh, I know that Erikson likes to butcher his characters, but what I felt in this book….Oh my, great characters died :S Erikson’s skill in creating most of characters and the history to the landscapes his characters must travel, helped a lot to love this book. Of course Fiddler, Crokus, Apsalar and Kalam had my biggest interest! <br><br>My Deadly Calm, <input type=""checkbox"" class=""spoiler__control"" aria-label=""The following text has been marked spoiler.

Finally, we were given a character whose innocence was not turned into sacrifice or angelic bla bla, but twisted into petty cruelty by the fucked up things that happened to her.

"<b>
  <i>The world's harbingers of death are many and varied.</i>
</b><br /><br />If I have noticed anything about Steven Erikson's writing after reading the first two books in <i>The Malazan Book of the Fallen</i> series, it's that he doesn't do anything halfway. In <b>
  <i>Deadhouse Gates</i>
</b> we are transported to a new continent, <i>Seven Cities</i>, and an almost entire new cast of characters. There are a few familiar faces from GotM, but not many. Now why would he do that, after such a great first book with characters we are now familiar with and the lovely continent of Genabackis? I will tell you why, because he doesn’t give a shit and he is a freaking genius.<br /> <br />I was a little skeptical for the first 30 or 40 pages feeling like I was starting over, but after that I was so enthralled with the new story and characters it didn't matter. The layout of this book is vast, with several groups of characters with their own agendas and missions. Not unlike GotM, but on a larger scale. I will admit to not completely understanding what was going on at times, but as I learned with book 1, you just have to push through and everything will work itself out.<br /> <br />The various storylines are each unique and take the reader on an epic journey of adventure, heroism, and heartbreak. Erikson has a knack for witty humor and morbid beauty in some of the most unlikely sections of the story. Whether it be out of place jest in a deadly situation or migrating butterflies in a horrendous battle scene, he is the master at turning a scene into a work of art. <br /><br /><b>
  <i>“Butterflies mobbed that straining, yearning reach, even as it slowly sank back down, then disappeared. The insects were converging, thousands, and hundreds of thousands. On all sides it seemed that the battle, the slaughter, paused and watched.”</i>
</b><br /><br />As in <i>GotM</i>, there are a lot characters in <i>Deadhouse Gates</i>, and each one is done extremely well. There are too many for me to include them all in my review, so I will just overview a few of my favorites.<br /><br /><b>
  <i>Iskaral Pust</i>
</b> – A high priest of Shadow, who is as obnoxious and insane as they come. He reminds me of Kruppe with all his antics, but he is still his own character. Also, like Kruppe there is an air of mystery around him.<br /><br /><b>
  <i>“I trust you are killing every spider you spy. You had better be, for it is the path to wisdom. Oh yes indeed, the path!”</i>
</b> – Iskaral Pust<br /><br /><b>
  <i>Icarium &amp; Mappo Trell</i>
</b> – A Jaghut wanderer and his companion. Their history is long, violent, and above all else very sad. I wouldn’t want to bet against either one of these warriors in a fight. I don’t care who it’s against.<br /> <br /><b>
  <i>“Blood and chaos is the wine and meat of the gods—most of them, anyway. Especially the ones most eager to meddle in mortal affairs. I will do nothing to achieve their desires.”</i>
</b> – Mappo Trell<br /><br /><b>
  <i>Duiker</i>
</b> – An imperial historian and one time soldier. He is probably the most ordinary character in the story, but I enjoyed his storyline the most.<br /><br /><b>
  <i>“Without our armor, we would all weep, I think. How else to answer the impending promise of incalculable loss?”</i>
</b> – Duiker <br /><br />There were many more characters that I enjoyed. Kalam, Fiddler, Coltaine, Felisin, and many more. From my interaction with other fellow Malazan enthusiasts I have been told the characters from <i>GotM</i> and <i>Deadhouse Gates</i> begin to intermingle in the coming books. I am eagerly looking forward to this, and all the amazing new characters I have yet to meet.<br /> <br />This was an awesome book that contains everything I love about epic-grim-dark fantasy. It’s crazy to see that I am only two books into this series. There is so much emotion wrapped up into just one of these books it feels like a series in itself. Yes, the end of this book broke my heart, but I have faith Mr. Erikson will avenge those who have fallen. Or my faith may be misplaced! <br /><br />Highly recommended to all! 5 stars *****<br />",5
"<b>This is such an epic story, I figured a typical review couldn't do it justice, so I asked for some help from the characters who always know best.</b><br /><br />Felisin: ""I was told there would be journeys to exotic locations, that I would meet many interesting people, and that I would be admired and even held in awe. Well, I could tell you a thing or two about such promises...""<br /><br />Coltaine: ""Hahahahahahahh....ahahahahahah - Geez, you really got me there (the sky - it's filled with crows ... so many crows ...).""<br /><br />High Fist Pormqual: ""I'm flying, I'm really flying, I'm weightless, I'm -""<br /><br />Historian Duiker: ""If you have the heart to see and the courage to witness it, you can find wisdom and compassion within the depths of madness and horror. That about sums it up.""<br /><br />Heboric Light Touch: (Pointing into the distance) ""See, now really look hard, that's your fate heading toward you with stone driven inevitability - we are but the playthings of the gods.""<br /><br />Crokus the Thief: ""Not a big part this time around, but I've put my hand up for more.""<br /><br />Apsalar: ""Personally, I thought the overall book was excellent and I was quite satisfied with what I was offered and I'm sure I'll see more of myself going forward, (slaps Crokus' reaching hand), now Crokus you haven't earned that yet...""<br /><br />Kulp the Mage: ""My scenes were for the most part excellent, however I do believe the story would have been strengthened with a couple of small changes, just a smidgen here and there - but does anyone listen to me. No...""<br /><br />Baudin: ""Well damn it. I really wish everyone would understand the difference between a Claw and a Talon. Right? Yes, am I right about that, or do I really have to come over there and demonstrate?""<br /><br />Fiddler: ""I don't know, I've got a Ph.D in Astro-Hyperdrive-Mechanics, and my agent sent me this role.

However, I have acquired a headache and I wonder if perhaps we drank too much at an Inn last night. I certainly hope nothing untoward has occurred. Perhaps tomorrow I will remember more...""<br /><br />Mappo Trell: ""I won the award for 'Best and most Loyal Friend,' enuf said.""<br /><br />Iskaral Pust: ""Despite my amazing best efforts, sad manners of the author has left me with less than the richly deserved Main Character role.

"While clearly a superior book, in my humble opinion, to the first Book of Malazan, I'm deeply disturbed by some of the turn of events at the end of the novel. Namely, WTF? Uggghhh. It makes me want to sit in silence for a while and try to digest it a bit, but no. A lot more things happen in this novel than just one man's (or many men's) reversal(s), be it choice and with so-called reason or utter desolation filled with a demon's pity. <br /><br />I was initially worried that I'd be bogged down in too much war, but no, that wasn't even a concern for me this time. I was too invested in the characters, especially the Assassin and the Historian. The thief was fun and the author's penchant and focus on old dead civilizations and archeology serves him extremely well here. The explorations really got my heart pumping even as my mouth dried.<br /><br />The refugees and the desperate march was particularly effective, too, but more than anything else, the promise and the fear evoked by the Whirlwind was very good.<br /><br />Ancient armies fighting endless battles, the dead all around, and the mortal armies of the Empire and the defenders, made this war extremely pernicious and chaotic, even if the gods weren't throwing wrenches into the spokes of everyone's war machines. We even got to travel by sea and pirate with the best of them.<br /><br />This novel may as well serve as the definition of Epic. The direction and the focus is always clear. The enormous cast, with all their hopeless desires, clash and collude on grand scales, while the plights stay close to the cuff.<br /><br />Oh yeah, and who loves the dogs? That's right. It's me. And I loved every instance where the Coins of the realm became the downfall of (often extremely literally) of nobles and the other financial ministers; I was laughing with delight, even.<br /><br />The deaths of the children were hard, but distance made a lot of it bearable. There's one scene with our fearless Historian that I'll never forget, even if I *know* it was a blatant attempt to tug at my heartstrings. It still worked like a freaking charm.<br /><br />Do I love the series? Yes. I do believe I do. I need a slight break though! Very emotional.<br /><br />:)",5
"Deadhouse Gates was an enjoyable read that unfortunately did not quite live up to the quality of its predecessor Gardens of the Moon. There was plenty of similarities between the two. It is Erkison writing this after all so we still got the excellent world building, a complex plot, a huge cast of characters each with their own set of motivations and goals, an incredibly cool magic system, fantastic action scenes featuring battles that were both mundane and sorcerous in nature, dragons, demons, strange non-human creatures, and a whole bunch of meddlesome gods! Erikson has an engaging writing style which is also a plus. <br /><br />Deadhouse Gates picks up shortly after the events in Gardens of the Moon. The action takes place on a new continent as the focus switches to the Seven Cities rebellion, which was hinted at in the first book. We have a whole host of new characters to learn, but luckily we also had some familiar faces in Kalam, Fiddler, Crokus, and Apsalar. <br /><br />The main negative of Deadhouse Gates is that the new setting of Seven Cities does not match Darujistan. Most of the time our characters were just plodding through desert wastes. Which got boring pretty quickly. Another issue I had was with the rebellion itself. In the first book we cared for characters on both sides of the conflict, but in this book all the member of the rebellion we meet are vile villainous characters. I was disappointed by that as I expected a bit more depth to the situation. <br /><br />Another slight downside was that the new characters did not quite live up to the ones who did not feature from the first book. Felisin is a terrible replacement for her brother Ganoes, it is almost impossible to like the girl! Her companions were little better. There was times when I dreaded returning to her POV. Dukier and the Chain of Dogs story arc was interesting and tragic, but it was a bit slow paced for my liking, especially in the first half of the book. Iskaral Pust was a fun character, but I could not help but feel that he was a poor mans Kruppe. Mappo and Icarium were the most entertaining and intriguing of the new characters. They were likable and their story arc was never dull. Kulp, Gesler, Stormy, and Truth did not play a significant role in this book, but they showed enough promise that I'll be happy to read more of their adventures. <br /><br />My final complaint is that we did not see enough of the Ascendants in this installment. They did appear, but I wanted more!<br /><br />I enjoyed Deadhouse Gates even if it was not quite as good as Gardens of the Moon. Erikson knows how to up the tension and the action in the final stages of his books and as a result the final third of the book did match the quality of Gardens of the Moon. <br /><br />Rating: 4 stars.<br /><br />Audio Note: Like the first book this was narrated by Ralph Lister. Lister is OK, but he does take a while to warm to. <br />",4
"Nearly two years late review but everyone else reading it and reviewing it brings back memories and I did read it two times so my memories are rather fresh,first translated version than revisited when I switched to original version on book 3.So this is more of a retrospective.<br /><br />What can I say, I struggled with Gardens of the Moon and I only gotten through on second attempt. World was overall complex and strange (at that point I was unacquainted with China Mieville so my standard for labeling something strange was LOT lower back than) but I seen potential so I kept on. It didn't take lot of time for that potential to be used as second book blowen me away. After this book I officially joined Malazan cult and after third book I decided that most other fantasy writers should be sacrificed as blood offering to Steven Erikson<br /><br />Story here is more straightforward (as much that can be said for Erikson) and slower paced. Erikson start getting more philosophical and it became obvious to me that this isn't just another fantasy flick. This is military fantasy but it's also has strong anti-war message. It's brutal and dark but also humane and warm.<br />As I became more familiar with Malazan world become more appreciative of slow and robust worldbuilding. It's world with long history and diverse cultures. Poems, proverbs and book fragments might not be relevant to the story but they add to world that's not just stage but leaving, breathing world and one of the stars of the show in it's own right. There are so many forces at play in this world and that makes Malazan book of fallen very unpredictable series but twists and turns always felt natural and not added there for shock value and so author can say ""I got you didn't I?""(yes Sanderson I'm looking at you).<br /><br />From that point on series only got better and Abercrombie finally got competition for my favorite fantasy author throne. <br /><br />",5
"4.5 Stars <br /><br />Much like its predecessor <a href=""https://goodreads.com/book/show/55399.Gardens_of_the_Moon__The_Malazan_Book_of_the_Fallen___1_"" title=""Gardens of the Moon (The Malazan Book of the Fallen, #1) by Steven Erikson"" rel=""noopener"">Gardens of the Moon</a>, Deadhouse Gates was a dense, challenging read with a complex, multilayered storyline. And like GoTM it's depth and complexity (repetition for emphasis*) made it an extremely rewarding read for anyone with the patience to see it through. This book once again throws the reader in at the deep end. After the arduous process of developing an understanding for this world in the first book, Erikson changes it all up again for this one. A new continent. A new war. New quests. And new characters. This is another book that requires time and effort to enjoy but much like GoTM it was well worth the effort. In fact I think this book was an improvement with a darker tone, more distinct, memorable storylines and old and new characters mixed seamlessly together. <br /><br />Again I think my expectations worked in my favour with this book. Before even starting this series I had heard from friends that Erikson frequently changed the setting and characters from book to book. So while I can understand the shock and dismay of readers who didn’t see this coming I was able to accept it fairly easily. While this book required patience and effort to really appreciate I found it more accessible than ‘Gardens’. This book had a stronger opening that was more easily understood, more distinctive storylines and the return of some familiar faces. I’ve heard some people recommend starting the series with this book but I disagree. While this one was an easier and somewhat better read I would still recommend starting with Gardens in order to get a better understanding of the world and especially the characters in this one. <br /><br />Erikson’s training as an archaeologist was apparent in the incredibly deep, ambitious world-building of this book. Erikson subtly hints at the vast history of this world throughout without ever resorting to info-dump’s. One of the best scenes in this book occurs when some of the characters stumble into the ruin of an ancient city and piece together the events that led to its downfall. In contrast I found the obscure magic system frustrating. Magic plays an important role in this story and yet the rules of magic in this world are left extremely vague, and magic often serves as a Deus Ex Machinima. This makes the frequent confrontations involving various magical entities confusing as it's impossible to tell how powerful each person is or what they can do.<br /><br /><br />The defining arc of this book (and according to some fans, this entire series) was the ‘Chain of Dogs’. This was a brutal, poignant and unforgettable story. Duiker’s opening sections expertly built the tension for the ‘Apocalypse’. And when it came Coltaine’s heroic, doomed march was one of the best plotlines I’ve ever read, filled with brilliant set-piece battles, brutal skirmishes and insightful ruminations on the nature of war. It also produced some of the most moving and memorable scenes I can remember. From the butterflies who's beauty contrasted so powerfully with the carnage of Vathar crossing, to the poignancy of 'The Fall' within sight of the walls of Aren to the unexpected hopefulness of the epilogue. The dry, bleak humour that was present throughout (especially in Duiker’s discussions with Bult and Coltaine) also did a great job of easing the tension. While Erikson sometimes over-did it with the internal monologues and philosophising, in this storyline it felt appropriate. When the other POV’s discussed philosophy it felt strangely out of place (Felsisin's almost schizophrenic switches between being a bratty child and a profound philosopher were especially weird) for their characters, however Duiker’s commentary on war always felt appropriate, both as a historian analysing the nature of conflict and an old soldier who still believed in the ideals of courage, duty and loyalty. <br /><br />The other storylines were also interesting and enjoyable. From the start of this book Felisin’s story set a bench mark for being grim and brutal in a way not seen in GoTM. I found Felisin to be a brilliantly-written character. While many fans of the series hated her intensely, even at her most cruel and spiteful, I still had sympathy for her. The knowledge of the brutal trials she had undergone combined with her often unpleasant actions made her an extremely complex and challenging character. Some of the best secondary characters I’ve seen so far in this series also appeared in her storyline. Stormy and Gesler were another example of the tough, grizzled veterans that Erikson is so fond of. While they were an over-used trope they were possibly the most brilliantly written example I’ve seen of it. Their instantly likeability and hilarious banter was handled better even than the Bridgeburners. Another standout character was Baudin. Erikson has a tendency to go over-board in establishing how badass his massive cast of warriors, sorcerers and dragons are so it was really refreshing how clever and subtle the establishment of Baudin as a BAMF was. <br /><br />In the other major storylines some familiar faces from the first book are on a mission to save the Malazan empire…. by assassinating the empress. Meanwhile Icarium, a powerful and ancient being, struggles to remember who he is and what he’s done. It’s the duty of Mappo, his companion and closest friend to protect him. And to protect the world <i> from </i> him. These 3 storylines overlap and separate at different times throughout the book and for the most part they were enjoyable. I was glad to see some familiar faces from GoTM (Kalam, Fiddler, Crokus and Apsalar) although their sections were some of the slowest at the start. I really liked the relationship between Icarium and Mappo and the gradual reveal of Icarium’s past. <br /><br />Overall the pacing of this book was pretty good and a noticeable improvement on GoTM. The opening was stronger and the main plot-lines were all established early on. The plot dragged a bit during the sections where character were wandering through the desert though. I was also occasionally frustrated by Erikson throwing too many mystical/magical elements into a scene in a heavy-handed attempt to make it 'epic'. <input type=""checkbox"" class=""spoiler__control"" aria-label=""The following text has been marked spoiler. Toggle checkbox to reveal or hide."" onchange=""this.labels[0].setAttribute('aria-hidden', !this.checked);"" id=""be3aa090-fe23-4311-b4e9-94361f6b6c11"" /><label aria-hidden=""true"" class=""spoiler"" for=""be3aa090-fe23-4311-b4e9-94361f6b6c11""> For example after spending 20 pages carefully setting the scene and building anticipation for a tense showdown between a gang of bloodthirsty pirates and Kalam with a squad of outnumbered marines at his back… Erikson then got bored and threw in some kind of magical sorcerer-dragon (it had a really long, awkward name that I’m pretty sure didn’t appear in the series before and I can’t remember now) that immediately made the showdown irrelevant. This was a really disappointing, lazy end to what could have been a great section. </label> I really liked the conclusion of this book though. Unlike GoTM there was no point where every plotline neatlly converged. Instead each individual arc had an interesting and separate conclusion. Also Erikson didn’t try so hard to produce an ‘epic’ climax and instead delivered subtle, well-written conclusions that wrapped up the storylines for this book while making it intriguing to see how the characters involved (at least those who survived) would continue their stories in the books to come. <br /><br />This was another dense, challenging read that was ultimately well worth the time and effort. The scope of the world and story that was hinted at in GoTM is starting to be revealed in this one and I’m really excited to see where this series goes from here.<br />",4
"<i>Deadhouse Gates</i> is the second book in Steven Erikson’s brilliant and uber-epic ten-volume fantasy series, ""The Malazan Book of the Fallen"" (MBotF). I think this is now the third time I’ve read this book and it still remains one of my favorites. <i>Deadhouse Gates</i> is nothing short of a ‘nail-biter’ from the get-go and the pacing is utterly relentless. I have to say that <i>Deadhouse Gates</i> is an easier read than Erikson’s first book in the MBotF series, <i>Gardens of the Moon</i>, and much of that is because the reader is slowly, but surely, becoming more familiar with Erikson’s writing style and more comfortable with the unique qualities of the Malazan world that he has crafted.<br /><br />In my opinion, <i>Deadhouse Gates</i> is a fine example of what I truly love the most about the MBotF series, and that is Erikson’s ability to make his readers empathize with the characters in his books. One thing that really impresses me about Erikson’s characters is that they are all typically people that the reader can relate to, and there are really very few, if any, characters that aren’t flawed in one fashion or another. Also, Erikson’s MBotF characters exhibit a strong dose of egalitarianism, as men and women in the books commonly occupy positions of authority and responsibility across all walks of life in the Malazan world. <br /><br />Much of <i>Deadhouse Gates</i> occurs on the continent of “Seven Cities” and introduces a whole new cast of characters from those presented in <i>Gardens of the Moon</i>. Never fear though, of the multiple story arcs in <i>Deadhouse Gates</i>, one arc does involve a small group of characters that the reader met in <i>Gardens of the Moon</i> and who become quite important to the storyline in this episode. As is typical of Erikson novels in the MBotF series, there are plots and sub-plots galore swirling around throughout this 600+ page book (trade-paperback edition), and each of them is an attention-grabber, and at times contain a powerful ‘punch to the gut’.<br /><br />Without giving away anything of significance away, <i>Deadhouse Gates</i> revolves around the rebellion of many of the subjugated peoples of the Seven Cities continent. This rebellion is known as “The Whirlwind” and is intended to rid the continent of all of the Malazan occupiers, both administrative and military. The main plot of the novel is one that just takes your breath away—that of the tactical retreat of the Malazan Seventh Army over several hundred leagues from one city to another. The Malazan Seventh is commanded by Coltaine, a Wickan Crow Clan warchief, and now a Fist (General) in the Malazan Army. Fist Coltaine and many of the other Wickan characters are some of my favorites in the entire MBotF series, and the Wickan Clans themselves—with names like “Foolish Dog Clan”, “Weasel Clan, and “Crow Clan”—reminded me of some of the Native American tribes that so effectively battled the U.S. Army in the latter half of the 19th century.<br /><br />Honestly, the story of the Seventh Army’s retreat across the landscape of Seven Cities is truly nothing short of epic, as Coltaine must try and not only preserve the fighting capacity of the Seventh Army, but protect more than 50,000 refugees that his forces are endeavoring to shepherd to safety. This plot thread that weaves through much of the novel becomes known as “Coltaine’s Chain of Dogs”, a moniker of significant distinction and pride to the members of the Seventh Army, as well as the rest of the Malazan Empire. As a veteran of the military myself, there was something in this story of the “Chain of Dogs” that truly tugged at the heartstrings of my very soul, and I cannot begin to tell you how many times while reading about the desperate attempts of the Seventh Army to survive its horrifying trek across Seven Cities that I had to set the book aside for a few moments and simply let the tears roll down my cheeks. While at times a terribly tragic story, the tale of Coltaine’s “Chain of Dogs” is also one that exhibits the finest qualities of humanity—courage, compassion, comradeship, and Love. <br /><br />Erikson's description of this epic journey, and the battles fought along the way, rivals any that have been written about in numerous superb non-fiction military histories. Examples that immediately come to mind include the U.S. Continental Army’s retreat from New York to Valley Forge, or Napoleon’s Grande Armee’s retreat from Russia, or Field Marshal von Manstein's strategic retreat of several German armies across the frozen steppes of southern Russia in early 1942 (after the fall of Stalingrad). Erikson’s tale of the “Chain of Dogs” in <i>Deadhouse Gates</i> is some of the best military fiction I’ve ever read, and should appeal to readers with even a passing interest in military or historical fiction or non-fiction.<br /><br />But wait, there’s even more—So much more! <i>Deadhouse Gates</i> is also chock full of important plot and story lines that really help to begin to open up the full breadth and scope of the Malazan world to the reader. There are significant tie-backs to important events and happenings in <i>Gardens of the Moon</i>, as well as explanations of the fascinating and complex system of magic and sorcery, and loads of new information about the mythology and significance of the pantheon of gods and goddesses who occupy the Malazan world. <i>Deadhouse Gates</i> can perhaps be best characterized as the ‘tale of multiple journeys’, with Coltaine’s “Chain of the Dogs” being the centerpiece, but there are also the journeys of several other groups of characters that are just as meaningful to the overall plot and are very, very important to future episodes in the MBotF series.<br /><br />I continue to be completely blown away with the sheer quality of the writing, the plotting, the character development, the pacing, the pathos and drama, and the sheer inventiveness and originality of the world that Erikson has created. Mr. Erikson doesn't pull his punches, this is truly some hard, bleak, and dark fiction; and it is at times viscerally tragic and profoundly sad. At the same time though, Erikson soars to heights almost unknown in fantasy fiction with his moments of triumph, success, and the joy of experiencing those fleeting instants of pure and unbridled goodness and humanity.<br /><br />In closing, I highly and unhesitatingly recommend this series; and, in my opinion, <i>Deadhouse Gates</i> is much more than a quantum step forward from the first novel in the series, <i>Gardens of the Moon</i>. <i>Deadhouse Gates</i> was the book in the MBotF series that cemented my love affair with all things Malazan. Read <i>Deadhouse Gates</i>--you’ll become a believer too!<br /><br />***",5
"My Malazan Book of the Fallen re-read continues with Deadhouse Gates. I was looking forward to revisiting this novel, remembering that it contained great characters, memorable journeys, and soul-wrenching heartache.<br /><br />After getting to know the characters that were featured throughout Gardens of the Moon, Erikson introduces a mostly new ensemble in Deadhouse Gates. The events of this book take place throughout the Seven Cities, including the Holy Desert Raraku. This continent is occupied by the Malazan Empire yet, driven by the prophetess Sha'ik and the Whirlwind, a rebellion is gaining traction. <br /><br />Throughout this tale, we follow half a dozen varied characters and groups, focusing on their journeys, agendas, or sorrow. One such band features some returning players from the previous entry, Bridgeburners Fiddler (sapper), Kalam (assassin), Apsalar (assassin), and Darujhistan resident Crokus. Elsewhere, we have the wanderings of two friends, Icarium and Mappo, both formidable warriors, one of whom is dangerously overpowered and has obliterated entire cities. Another main focus is that of Felisin Paran who has been betrayed by her elder sister following the Malazan Empire's culling of certain noble houses. The most notable perspective in Deadhouse Gates and one that is hugely influential to the entire series is the Imperial Historian Duiker's account of the Malazan's 7th army during the uprising. The 7th is commanded by Fist, Wickan Crow Clan leader, war-veteran, and former enemy of the Malazan Empire, Coltaine. The narratives in Deadhouse Gates feel more focused and palatable to what was presented previously in Gardens of the Moon, with each group having duties and motives that we follow, some of which are more obvious than others. <br /><br />‘No-one who’s grown up amidst scrolls and books can write of the world,’ Kellanved had told him once, ‘which is why I’m appointing you Imperial Historian, soldier.’ ‘Emperor, I cannot read or write.’ ‘An unsullied mind. Good. Toc the Elder will be teaching you over the next six months – he’s another soldier with a brain. Six months, mind. No more than that.’ ‘Emperor, it seems to me that he would be better suited than I—’ ‘I’ve something else in store for him. Do as I say or I’ll have you spiked on the city wall.’<br /><br />Although I enjoyed following every perspective, there is a lot of travelling and wandering and this led to some segments dragging, therefore, being not that fun to read. With the 7th army, some of the action from the skirmishes blurred and seemed repetitive. This may have all been intentional by the author with the chaos and confusion presented not being crystal clear or easy to follow, it highlights the desperation and ups the stakes as this storyline approaches its devastating conclusion. This all being said, there are frequent moments of camaraderie and wit, in addition to heightened set-piece spectacles. One scene that stands out is a moment where Coltaine wishes to reward a soldier for bravery yet, without intending to, demotes his rank, leading to awkward and comic results. These subtle moments of humanity, confusion, and events not always going a set way, however well-intentioned, add to the dramatic impact of this storyline. <br /><br />If how Grimdark a book is was solely rated by the levels of violence and tragedy then Deadhouse Gates would feature highly on such a scale. Lots of awful things happen, such as the unpleasant and dark horrors presented to Felisin throughout her fall from grace and the resulting journey. I will also note that I clearly remembered a character death that features in Deadhouse Gates from my first read 8 years ago. It shocked me then and was no less impactful on a second visit. What made this moment stand out is that it was an absolutely unpredictable and underserved death for a likeable, important cast member. This defied my expectations and changed the way I followed and cared for characters in later entries because everyone is expendable and even if a character is a fan-favourite, they will probably not get the spectacular death that their deeds warrant. <br /><br />""Who in the Abyss has such power? He could think of but two: Anomander Rake, the Son of Darkness, and Osric. Both Soletaken, both supremely arrogant. If there were others, the tales of their activities would have reached him, he was certain. Warriors talk about heroes. Mages talk about Ascendants. He would have heard.""<br /><br />We are presented with more insight into the magic scheme of warrens, mages, ascendants and gods in Deadhouse Gates. I adored the sense of dread, uncertainty, and powerlessness that players faced when finding themselves lost in a warren or fighting against extremely capable magic users. Following on from some of his exchanges in this book, I am already remembering why the ascendant Cotillion went on to become one of my favourite characters in the series <br /><br />With the conflicts and revolution showcased in this novel, living in this world is difficult enough, and that is before you add into the mix shapeshifters, demons, undead dragons, deadhouses, and a spider-despising priest whose sanity is questionable. These high stakes and immense risks are probably one of the main reasons that I enjoy following and rooting for characters like Fiddler. He is not an overpowered mage or god-possessed assassin, he is a witty and honourable veteran soldier in an extremely dangerous environment. <br /><br />I had a great time returning to Seven Cities and having the Malazan Empire expanded again to me as a reader. The world showcased here feels gritty, deadly, and dark, making some of the locations and set pieces in Gardens of the Moon seem almost cartoony by comparison. The novel's finale is epic and intense, a tear-jerker that has stayed with me ever since I read it the first time. It does not get any easier to bear the second time. To conclude, quite simply, I consider Deadhouse Gates to be an incredible and impactful epic fantasy read. 9/10. <br /><br />""Lull nodded. ‘That’s a succinct summary of humankind, I’d say. Who needs tomes and volumes of history? Children are dying. The injustices of the world hide in those three words. Quote me, Duiker, and your work’s done.’""",5
"and the award for Most Improved Second Book in a Series goes to... Deadhouse Gates! this was an excellent novel and I was fascinated from beginning to end. Erikson's prose and character work and his juggling of several compelling, intertwining narratives did not disappoint. the prior novel Gardens of the Moon felt at times as if it were written by a drunk 17-year-old; Deadhouse Gates was written by an experienced and empathetic adult who has grown emotionally and whose skills on the page now equal the exciting imagination he's clearly had all along.<br /><br />Erikson's background as an archaeologist is readily apparent in the book. the scenes with various characters unearthing and imagining and becoming affected by past individuals and fallen civilizations were some of the novel's strongest. more importantly, the book itself feels like an archaeological experience. Erikson doesn't infodump, it's like it is anathema to him. the reader must sift and sort through the various clues and details and recollections to build this world up in their mind. Erikson has fully envisioned his world, that much is obvious, but he forces the reader to make sense of the world all on their own (maps and appendices notwithstanding). it is the reader who must build the world because Erikson doesn't deliver it as a ready-made, easily digested package. I love having to work for my pleasures, it makes the end result all the more satisfying.<br /><br />my first paragraph was actually a comment I made in a review thread. the second comes from ideas that other reviewers have given me. so as long as I'm in a thieving mood, I'll steal some more and just copy, paste, and only slightly adjust my comments from the group that inspired me to pick up this novel (thank you, Beyond Reality):<br /><br />SOME SPOILERS AHEAD<br /><br />- one of the things I loved realizing was that despite the richness and complexity of this novel, Erikson still retains a real economy of words. which makes a dense book even denser<br /><br />- the grueling and intense ""Chain of Dogs""is really what makes the book so unique for me. very well done<br /><br />- warrens remain mysterious but now, due to this book, I feel like I can actually wrap my mind around them. I want one!<br /><br />- the three child wizards were awesome<br /><br />- Azath Houses continue to intrigue, such a brilliant concept<br /><br />- that bit in the beginning with Ryllandaras in his multiple wolf bodies was fascinating and I want to see more of that character<br /><br />- the horses! love their strong personalities, they almost overshadow their riders<br /><br />- those dogs had a lot of personality too<br /><br />- the scene set on the otherworldly ship Silanda was fantastic<br /><br />- amidst all of the surprising bits of compassion and warmth (so necessary to have within all the slaughter, thank you Erikson), weirdly enough one of the most moving and endearing things to me was the relationship between the demon Apt and her adopted, transformed child Panek. I really want to see more of those two, such an intriguing pair<br /><br />- Iskaral Pust muttering his sneaky secret thoughts out loud was a running joke that just never got old. loved all of that.<br /><br />- I like how Erikson plays with tone. the weird comedy of Icarium &amp; Mappo in the Shadow Temple contrasted well with the darkness of Felisin's story<br /><br />initial thoughts on Felisin, a third of the way through the book:<br />- poor Felisin. I think Erikson really did a great job with her character, making her very sympathetic and showing how few options she had and why she chose her particular path. I like how he shows her strengths and weaknesses and doesn't just put her purely into a victim role (although obviously she is a victim, the biggest one in the novel so far). her story starts out being tragic and just gets darker and darker but it never felt exploitative, just sad and even realistic<br /><br />second thoughts on Felisin, two-thirds of the way through:<br />- she's horrible. I understand how she got to the place she's at and I think it is a strong decision to make a character who has now decided she was in love with her abuser a central, point of view character. but she's still a challenge to read about. so mindlessly spiteful and petty. I probably would have knocked her over the side of the ship if I wasn't aware of her back story.<br /><br />final thoughts on Felisin:<br />- her arc is amazing and the power she exhibits at the end is really well-earned. so impressed by how Erikson wrote her, the complexity of her character, her weaknesses and her strengths<br /><br />- I love that Erikson is committed to diversity in his Malazan world. strong and empowered women, different orientations, and I love how easy it is for me to imagine most of these characters as brown or black or all sorts of other shades. even gray with a slight greenish tone, sure why not, I'm sure that color looks lovely on Icarium<br /><br />END OF SPOILERS<br /><br />I don't want to give the impression that this is a perfect book. it's not; it has a good number of flaws. but I enjoyed this experience so much that I don't particularly want to even get into them, they're minor anyway. even with its imperfections, this is an amazing book.",4
"Picking up where Gardens of the Moon left off, Deadhouse Gates reunites a host of old characters and throws some new ones into the fray. This time the action is focused not on Genabackis, but on the continent of seven cities. Of the expansive cast that appeared in Gardens of the Moon, only Kalam, Fiddler, Apsalar and Crokus make a reappearence.<br /><br />The characters are so well created and interact with their world so affectively, that at times its hard not to feel you're actually experiencing the often hopeless situations that they're constantly enduring. Erikson has woven a great deal of sympathy into this epic. <br /><br />Deadhouse Gates is just one of those books that stick with you.",4
"In lots of fantasy, and in series in particular, I get frustrated with authors continually repeating their explanations and descriptions of certain things. For example, how many times does Robert Jordan remind the reader that an Aes Sedai has an ageless face? Goodkind's Sword of Truth series would probably be less than half of its current length if not for all the needless repetition.<br /><br />No-one will ever accuse Erikson of having this failing? The main frustration I have in these first books is that there is never reminders of who someone is, or what some race is, etc... In this book, one of the main characters is Mappo. He is a Trell. What's a Trell? I still have no idea. It's possible that Erikson told me somewhere in the beginning. But he doesn't distinguish between what's important and what isn't as he is writing, so I didn't catch it, if he did say so. Mappo has a companion named Icarium, who is a Jhag. What's a Jhag? I still don't know. Again, its possible that its in the book, but its not brought out in a way that held my attention. Maybe this is my laziness, and maybe not. My sense, however, is that Erikson prefers to hide information from the reader, and sometimes it feels to me like he's hiding it simply for the sake of hiding it.<br /><br /><br />So why four stars? Mostly because the book unfolded in a way that was very satisfying. The ending is really great. There are more than a handful of characters that I liked following. And it does now feel like this is shaping up to be a really big story that may be worthwhile when completely told.<br /><br />ON REREAD: Bumped to five stars. The structure of this book is much tighter than I realized on the first read. And I came to have genuine felling for several of the characters, making the various endings even more heartbreaking than they were on first read.<br /><br />Looking at my early review, I now know what a Trell is, and what a Jhag is. Does it matter all that much for my appreciation? Hard to say. I think its more important to understand the relationship between Mappo and Icarium, and how touching that relationship is. If I had understood what it meant that Icarium is a Jhag, I might have gotten more the first time around from the stunning reveal in the Azath house at the end of this book.<br /><br />I no longer think Erikson hides information for the sake of hiding it, or at least not solely for that reason. He's an archeologist, and he's trying to give some of the pleasures of archeology to his readers. But that means that the readers, like the archeologist, must often dig with teaspoons, and must also keep careful track of what they have already found. The job of making the connections is the reader's job, not Eriksons. This can be frustrating, and first go round, it definitely was. But the second time through, it was even more enjoyable. And I still have the sense that I would probably discover more on another reading.<br /><br />And then for the great stuff: Erikson has a tremendous sense of humor, and its needed, because he also has one of the keenest gifts for tragedy. And this book delivers both on very grand scale. In the Gardens of the Moon there is a passage where a character asks a T'lann Imass what he is thinking about. ""Futility."" he answers. The questioner then asks if that is what other T'lann Imass think of. He says: ""No, they mostly refrain from thinking at all."" Why? the questioner asks. ""Because it is futile."" <br /><br />This book takes the question of futility and lifts it up for study. The entire Chain of Dogs can be seen as either impossibly heroic, or impossibly futile. Perhaps both. And the same goes for Mappo's ""guidance"" of Icarium, and for Kalam's quest to assassinate Laseen. ",5
"Malazan is nothing like other fantasy books, the world is so broad, I now get why they are but few old characters in it, if all of them were in this , it would have been more complex than the first book thereby making it hard to understand, thus the dividing of the books by characters. The seven cities that The Malazan empire conquered was discussed here indepthly, how the people are regarded by Malazans and how they regard the Malazns.<br /><br /><b>
  <i>'Children are dying.'<br />Lull nodded. 'That's a succinct summary of humankind, I'd say. Who needs tomes and volumes of history? Children are dying. The injustices of the world hide in those three words. Quote me, Duiker, and your work's done.'</i>
</b><br /><br />The magic system is none like I’ve ever read before, there is literally nothing the magic cannot do, disappearing, teleporting, healing, rebirth, bringing people back from the dead and lots more, its so hard to know who is actually dead in this, even when you can see their dead bodies, they might have Ascended you can never tell, that is Malazan for you.<br /><br />The diversity in this book is the best I’ve read in my life. Lots of different races, cultures and creatures you’ve never heard of before(made up) which makes it amazing, what is fantasy without made up creatures. Some of the races that I love are the Tiste Andii, Jaghut cause of Icarium, Trell cause of Mappo and human race cause am human, they are also shape shifters and cool creatures like dragons.<br /><br />I love the way the author depicted the religion in this, the gods and goddesses that keep meddling in mortal life, spirit worshippers, elder gods, Ascendants’ all have their worshippers. This book is not short of romance either, they are a few couples, but its the friendship and loyalty between the characters that I love most.<br /><br /><b>
  <i>Only two kinds of people die in battle, Fiddler had once said, fools and the unlucky.</i>
</b><br /><br /><u>World building and Writing</u> <br />Like I mentioned earlier the world is so broad and the author depicted it perfectly, there was no confusion or anywhere in the world that was hard to imagine. The world is as big as Brandon’s Cosmere and this is all in one series, imagine the brilliancy of the author. The writing style adapted here is way easier to read than that of the first book, the demarcation between POV shift was made clearly, also the characters with POVs here were only few in number, just five major ones and seven minor ones that have just few paragraphs and some few chapters. The book is written in third person multiple POV.<br /><br /><u>Characters and Plot</u><br /><b>Icarium</b> is a jaghut, a non human race, he has greenish skin, grey hair and is seven feet tall, jaghut are extremely powerful and very hard to kill, despite this Icarium is neither arrogant nor mean, he is very kind and his friendship with Mappo his friend and companion is so adorable.<br /><b>Mappo Runt</b> is a trell, a nomadic creature, looks more giantish than human, trells are very powerful and are great warriors, just like his friend he is also kind, his loyalty to Icarium is like nothing I’ve ever seen before, its amazing.<br />The two of them are looking for answers to Icarium’s mysterious past.<br /><br /><b> Felisin Paran</b>, I liked her at first then disliked her when she became bitter and bitchy, now I like her again because she changed and has become something more, She is also the youngest character in the book. <br /><b>Heboric light touch</b> former everything, he was once a thief, a priest and a historian, his both hands has been cut off so he is literally handless, but its Malazan an old man with no hands is more than he looks.<br /><b>Baudin</b> is more than what he looks like, everything about him is a spoiler so go read it 😜.<br />The three of them are the weirdest companions ever! The circumstances that threw them together is even more bizarre and ruthless.<br /><br /><b>Duiker</b> is a former soldier turned historian, he goes to battle with soldiers and later document it. His POV is filled with battles scenes, politics and scheming.<br /><b>Coltaine and his Crow clan</b> are a group of soldiers that did the impossible, Coltaine is the definition of a leader, his Wickan clan all but worship him, the man rarely loose men in battles cause of his great mind and has never lost a battle( come fight me if you count what happen as lost).<br /><br /><b>Fiddler, Kalam, Apsalar and Crokus</b> are the only characters from the previous book(apart from Cotillion and Shadowthrone), their story picked up where it ended in Gardens of the moon, with them taking Apsalar home, we all know things won’t go exactly according to plan, things happened on the way like a rebellion against the Malazan empire, a convergence of sharp shifters, prophecy and many others.<br /><br /><b>Shadowthrone and Cotillion</b> just cannot stay away from mortals, but their interference here is only but minimal.<br /><br />Apsalar blew my mind here...<br /><br /><b>
  <i><br />Apsalar sprang at the other two men, flashing beneath the lanceheads, both knives thrusting up and out as she slipped between the horses. Neither Gral had time to parry. As if in mirror reflection, each blade vanished up and under the ribcage, the one on the left finding a heart, the one on the right rupturing a lung.<br />Then she was past, leaving both weapons behind. A dive and a shoulder roll avoided the lance of a fourth rider Fiddler hadn't seen earlier. In a single, fluid motion, Apsalar regained her feet and sprang in an astonishing surge of strength, and was suddenly sitting behind the Gral, her right arm closing around his throat, her left reaching down over the man's head, two fingers sinking deep into each eye, then yanking back in time for the small knife that suddenly appeared in her right hand to slide back across the warrior's exposed throat.</i>
</b><br /><br />She sure is badass and efficient.",5

I'm not, <b>I know that I'm not</b>, I usually can really dig in and understand what is going on in most fantasy. But in this series it is so dense that I read all the words and feel like I'm maybe only picking up a third of what I should be.<br><br>The world building is immense and Steven Erickson isn't afraid to be brutal and kill everyone in the book you liked. But are they really dead???? Well that is another issue altogether because they could be reborn<b> OR</b> they could have Ascended (<i>become something close to a god</i>) or they are just food for the bloodflies. <br><br>As the very lovely Miche suggested in the comments I’m going to try and use the Tor.com Malazan reread forum for the next book and see if that cuts down on my confusion for this series as it feels like I need college level credit to read this.<br><br>What I do like about the series is that in a lot of ways it is different from a lot of the fantasy I read. Usually you have the good guys and the bad guys and it is clear who is who. Even when there are shades of grey for character depth YOU KNOW who to root for. I’m still at a loss as to who should get my vote to win.<br><br>This book was darker and much more brutal than the last book. Also there is a huge plot line revolving around a military campaign ⇠ Not my favorite thing usually. But reading the story of Coltaine and the army he lead that was trying to help get the Malazan refugees to safety was one of the most heart wrenching things I’ve read and made me hate almost everyone else in the Malazan Empire. The way that particular arc played out pretty well tore me up and I really was glad when a few people got just what they deserved and less glad with the others they seemed to take down with them.<br><br>The other line containing Felisin, Heboric and Bauden was also just as brutal but in different ways. I felt so sorry for Felisin and the struggles that she had to go through and how far from the girl she was she fell. Heboric was intriguing to me, a priest/historian that forsake his god. His musings, insights and journey to discover the power within himself was one to pay close attention to. Bauden ended up being one of my favorite characters and I really hoped for trio to have an everlasting bond. <input type=""checkbox"" class=""spoiler__control"" aria-label=""The following text has been marked spoiler.

I’m glad he met a few new people/things during his journey and I’m hoping we see more of him later in the series too.<br><br>Sorry/Apsalar was one of my favorite characters in the first book. She is one of the few characters from that to get any page time in this, though through Fiddler’s eyes. She is still quite a mystical force and just this side of creepy sometimes. Still her Journey back towards her home in search of her father was one of my favorites in this book. There was at least some kind of hope in that journey and I was glad to see that she retains some skills from her time under the thumb of Shadow. <br><br>Mappo and Icarium’s role in the book was interesting. I liked finding little tidbits out about the duo’s journeys and why they have been together for over 200 years basically wandering the desert. They were almost the comic relief of the book and by the end there story was as hopeful as it was heartbreaking and spoke to the depths someone would go for their best friend and companion.<br><br>Overall I struggled with the darkness and misery of this book. There are some funny moments and such but overall 98%, <i>that might be a slight exaggeration but not by much</i>, of the people I liked ended up dead. Also there are some really horrifically brutal scenes in this book that while poignant to the story they also left a little bit of a sour taste in my mouth. That is probably what was intended but it was just a little too much sometimes.<br><br>I’m hoping that the next book in the series might have a little happiness in it.</[""br""]></[""br""]></[""br""]></[""br""]></[""br""]></[""br""]></[""br""]></[""br""]></[""br""]></[""br""]></[""br""]></[""br""]></[""br""]></[""br""]></[""br""]></[""br""]></[""br""]></[""br""]></[""br""]></[""br""]></[""br""]></[""br""]></[""br""]></[""br""]>",3

  <b>Paths.</b>

  <b>Path of Hands, Path of Sha’ik and Path of Chained Dogs.</b>
</i><br><br><i>
  <b>Path of Hands</b>
</i> is a story about two species of shapeshifting creatures and convergence they are hurdling to. <br>Those two species are called <i>
  <b>Soletakens</b>
</i> and <i>
  <b>D’ivers.</b>
</i> The main difference between them, as their name is suggesting, is that Soletaken shapeshifter can change itself into one creature <input type=""checkbox"" class=""spoiler__control"" aria-label=""The following text has been marked spoiler.

Although every single character we are following in this book at some point will take part in this story, it’s actually something that no one is paying too much of attention to. It’s always briefly mentioned and lurks somewhere in peripheral vision of both character's and our minds. Its build up is gradual <i>(not to say slow),</i> until obviously, the very end and a crescendo that will blow up in our faces.<br><br><i>
  <b>Path of Sha’ik</b>
</i> is more of a story of a prophecy than of a rebellion. Even though, one irrevocably evokes the other. It’s a story that questions legitimacy of a prophecy and a legitimacy of a rebellion, and all of the atrocities that are committed in it, as a result. <br><br>In contrast to story above, this one is more personal story, and not just because we are following major part of it through the eyes of a young girl and witnessing her being shaped into a monster because of the monstrous society that surrounds her, but ultimately because this is a story about vendetta. Vengeance. Be that one nation’s against one occupying Empire or just one sister against the other.<br><br><i>
  <b>Path of Chained Dogs</b>
</i> story focuses more on rebellion than anything else. But instead giving us perspective of ‘always righteous, freedom fighting’ rebels we are witnessing it through the eyes of soldiers who are protecting refugees forced to flee vengeful and blood thirsty faith militants.<br><br>This is a story that has everlasting and never-ending crescendo. It starts with one, it lasts through 900 pages of this novel and it ends with it.<br>It has everything one wishes in militaristic epic fantasy: big battles, skirmishes, diversions, conflicts of different types of magic etc. It has everything that needs to keep you on edges of your seats.<br>But it has a knack.<br>It’s excruciatingly emotionally exhausting. It’s painful. And I do not exaggerate.<br>It doesn’t romanticize conflict. It doesn’t romanticize fighting for freedom and it doesn’t romanticize bravery and sacrifice.<br><br>~~~~~<br><br><i>Brief summary:</i><br><br>To me, this is a book about <i>A Soldier.</i> Soldier who enters a conflict – be that a skirmish, major battle, naval battle or simply a conflict within yourself – as a one person, then while fighting their battles – be that with swords, crossbows, words or thoughts – circumstances of reality they found themselves in, mold and shape them, like a piece of clay, only to come out from that conflict as something completely different. And not necessarily a person.<br>It’s a story about humanity. And what we are capable of doing if we disregard it.<br><br><i>
  <b>“Does each of us, soldier or no, reach a point when all that we’ve seen, survived, changes us inside?<br>Irrevocably changes us? What do we become then? <br>Less human, or more human? Human enough, or too human?”</b>

  <b>
    <u>Characters.</u>
  </b>
</i><br><br>There’s an obvious difference in quality and progress since first book. And not just in writing a compelling emotional story, but also in far deeper characterization. Those from first book, as well as characters we are introduced to here for the first time.<br><br><i>

</i><br><br>One of the most developed characters of this series. <br><i>And probably most hateful.</i> <br>You see, whenever I would read this book, of those three main stories I have mentioned, I would focus mostly on story of refugees. And regardless of me wanted that or not, it’s already immersive enough and quite exhausting, so I would always <i>‘dull’</i> my attention span when it comes to Felisin and her companions. <br>And without scratching enough under the surface, I would always understand those who didn’t like her character. Even those who hated her with passion.<br>Now, when my main focus <i>was</i> her story, to all of those who have something bad to say about her – I’ll fight you!<br><i>(No I won’t.)</i> <br><br>But seriously though, for some reason, I would always dismiss her age. Which is 15. <br>So, when she was woken up in middle of the night, saw her parents being slaughtered, ended up shackled, escorted to a slave ship by her own sister, forced to work in mines, forced to use her body as a currency to survive a day – all of which happened before her first chapter of this book has even begun – she was 15.<br>Give this girl a break!<br><br>Her entire life was ripped away, she was shoved into an incredibly nasty environment with no preparation and she can't trust anyone because they could kill her, starve her or assault her.<br>And to be honest, what's the worst thing she's done in this book? She belittled an old geezer and was rude to a grown ass assassin, both of whom treated her like shit in any case. <br>OK, she's bitchy, she's rude and annoying. <br><br><b>She's 15 and given everything she went through, at that age, how is likely that you'll have enough of life experience to know that you can cope with your pain in other ways other than expressing it by being a little spiteful bitch towards everyone that treats you like shit?</b><br>I can understand that. <br>What's their <i>(Baudin and Heboric)</i> excuse for acting like they did? <br><br>But even with all this that I mentioned and all I will leave out from mentioning because of the spoilers, yeah sure, she was annoying. <br>Sometimes characters are purposefully written like that.<br>But if she, by the end of this book, or this series, ends up a monster, I’m not going to blame her. Nor will I pity her. <br>She’s a survivor. And she’s strong as hell. <i>
  <b>Karsa Olong</b>
</i> strong. <br>She’s an asshole. But, you know…<br><b>She is a self-possessed survivor who survives by any means necessary and to call her either a <i>'victim'</i> or <i>'cruel'</i> is to completely misread the character.</b><br>In my opinion, since I was kinda on the both sides of the spectrum.<br><br><i>
  <b>Cotillion.</b>
</i> Called Uncle by one-eyed, resurrected child of an <i>
  <b>Apt, Panek.</b>
</i><br><i>(Told you this is a heavy book.)</i><br><br><i>
  <b>“When I ascended it was to escape the nightmares of feeling... Imagine my surprise that I now thank you for such chains.”</b>
</i><br><br>Second best developed character of the series. <br>Even though his presence wasn’t as big in this book, he was mentioned so many times, and his actions reflected so many characters on so many different levels, that you had to realize how deep his character is. Every action negated his other action, but you realize that there’s a person behind it, who actively chooses to alter his efforts, so that others could live. Or die. Or simply get another chance.<br>An assassin. Now Ascendant. Assassins are supposed to be efficient and efficiency is by itself brutal. It sacrifices mortal lives for greater need. Like a machine. And could an assassin, even in godlike state, look at himself simply as a machine? Why bother with everything than? <br><br><i>
  <b>Mapo and Icarium.</b>
</i> Or simply called <i>
  <b>BFF’s.</b>
</i><br><br><i>
  <b>“We each have our protectors – neither of whom is capable of protecting us. Especially not from ourselves. So they’re dragged along, helpless, ever watchful, but so very helpless.”</b>
</i><br><br>Icarium’s endless quest for his lost memories. Because in him thrives hope that with gained memories there will come knowledge. And with knowledge understanding. Who and what he is. <br>But the curse is such that with every answer he finds, thousands of new questions arise. <br>Once he created mechanisms which counted time.<br>It’s a bitter irony, agony and a curse that now, without the knowledge of his past he cannot possibly know where he will go in future. Efficiently stopping him in time.<br><br><i>
  <b>Coltaine, Duiker, Wickans and 7th Malazan Army</b>
</i><br><br><i>
  <b>“Pogroms need no reason. None that can weather challenge, in any case. Difference in kind is the first recognition, the only needed, in fact. Land, domination, pre-emptive attacks – all just excuses, mundane justifications that do nothing but disguise the simple distinction. <br>They are not us. We are not them.”</b>
</i><br><br>Yes, I indeed consider them as one character. Spoken through the eyes of a historian Duiker, it tries to show that there’s nothing romantic about battles. That justification for atrocity can be found both in faith and noble battle for freedom. And it delivers. Spectacularly. Painfully.<br>By the end of this book, you will feel battered and exhausted, same as those soldiers, same as those refugees.<br><br>And like theme of the book itself, as I’ve mentioned above, where one enters a conflict only to exit as something else, hopefully, you will enter this book as someone who was simply interested in reading it, only to exit as a full admirer of what Erikson achieved here.<br><br><img src=""https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1514073588i/24748953._SX540_.png"" width="""" height="""" alt=""description"" class=""gr-hostedUserImg"" loading=""lazy""><br><br><i>

Instead, in <i>Deadhouse Gates</i>, his characters are on the march through new places with even grimmer situations than before. It sometimes feels like they are stuck on a really bad road trip with mayhem and death at every turn (and some heart-wrenching deaths at that). Despite that, this is neither simplistic nor a glorification of violence. <i>Deadhouse Gates</i> presents a multi-layered story in the context of a history that is still writing itself out in the backdrop of both new and ancient civilizations. Am I hooked? I am certainly intrigued and will be be continuing the series with the next book, <i>Memories of Ice</i>. At some point as well, I'll be rereading this and perhaps understanding some of what I missed. ",4
"Oh this book... It broke my heart too many times!<br><br><i>
  <b>“Children are dying.” Lull nodded. That’s a succinct summary of humankind, I’d say. Who needs tomes and volumes of history? Children are dying. The injustices of the world hide in those three words. Quote me, Duiker, and your work’s done.”</b>
</i><br><br>Deadhouse Gates is the second tale in the “Malazan Book of the Fallen” series, and it takes place after the events of the first book – Gardens of the Moon. Gardens of the Moon was relatively a tough read for me, since it had tons of characters and mainly – many unexplained events; Erikson just tosses you in a whole new world and expects you to deal with it – figuring things bit by bit and placing them together like a puzzle. This book, on the other hand, was much more readable (I guess?), even though Erikson presents a new set of characters on a whole new continent! Things begin to connect here, and the tough start really pays off. <br><br>I would say that Deadhouse Gates is the most horrible (in a good way?) and heartbreaking book I’ve ever read in my life. Erikson’s beautiful, sorrowful and precise descriptions made me shed a tear more than once. He dissects the human existence to its core elements and lets us peek inside – to the fear, desperation, despair and most importantly – the hope and the strength of the human spirit in the hardest moments imaginable. He is truly a master of the written word. <br><br><i>
  <b>“We totter on edges seen and unseen. We are reduced, yet defiant. We’ve lost the meaning of time. Endless motion broken only by its dulled absence—the shock of rest, of those horns sounding an end to the day’s plodding. For that moment, as the dust swirls on, no one moves. Standing in disbelief that another day has passed, and yet still we live.”</b>
</i><br><br><u>Plot (spoiler free)</u><br>Deadhouse Gates takes place on the continent of the Seven Cities, which are on a brink of rebellion against the Malazan empire. We have a few unconnected subplots and POVs. Some are more interesting than others. My favorite subplot is that of The Chain of Dogs, led by the talented commander – Coltaine of the Crow clan and told by the Malazan historian – Duiker. It’s the most horrible, heartbreaking and captivating thing you can find in this book (and others as well). Felisin’s plotline was interesting too, and my 2nd favorite. Icarium and Mappo were pretty awesome too. But the Chain of Dogs… Gods, it’s the sort of story that will leave you wordless, unable to communicate with the world outside and CRYING like a baby for days on end. Erikson, you beautiful, ruthless thing! <br><br>Coltaine:<br><img src=""https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1525186314i/25464286._SX540_.jpg"" width=""483"" height=""299"" alt=""description"" class=""gr-hostedUserImg"" loading=""lazy""><br><br><i>
  <b>“We go to partake of death. And it is in these moments, before the blades are unsheathed, before blood wets the ground and screams fill the air, that the futility descends upon us all. Without our armor, we would all weep, I think. How else to answer the impending promise of incalculable loss?”</b>
</i><br><br><u>World-building</u><br>Where should I begin? The Malazan world is the most complex world I’ve ever read about. There are different and interesting races, each with its unique and broad history. We have magic (which I still don’t fully comprehend), Gods that meddle in mortal affairs, Dragons, Shapeshifters, a whole undead race (and other undead things) and so much more. <br><br>Deadhouse Gates gets 5 out of 5 crows from me. Do yourselves a favor and read it!",5
"While not the emotional mess I was after the first reading of this book it certainly stirred my emotions and empathy. Tied with a few other books in this series as the best ever it held its own on a re-read. <br /><br />You realize the first time through how many Easter eggs Erikson leaves. The second time around you realize you missed more than you caught. All the subtle little references that sometimes don't come out until books down the road. It was so enjoyable marking them all and knowing what and when they referenced. <br /><br />In the end it was just as sad as the first time. I felt that same rage at the cruelty and wanted to personally hunt down fictional characters and crush them. Erikson doesn't spare his readers the horrors of the world. Much like his characters you are made to bare witness. You cannot turn away from tragedy and grief. <br /><br /><br /><b>Original Review</b><br />If I said to you an archaeologist and anthropologist wrote a set of books most people would think gee that must be a fun filled snore-fest. Yet it’s what makes Erikson so great. <br /><br />He starts with the land. What are the characteristics of the land? How did it shape the people, the civilization, and the wildlife. Then he goes deeper. What is the spirit of the land? What lies under the land in past civilizations? How did they change the land? Are their spirits chained to the land? What magic runs through it? I believe given his education everything starts the surface layer and then every and any detail going up, down, left, right and in spiritual or magical directions we cannot see are all factored in and meshed together in astonishing detail where what seems like unrelated all becomes interconnected. <br /><br />Then he takes the human element into account in the same multilayered fashion. No character is without fault. Every character is bound by motivation. They have failing, triumphs, tragedies, hopes, moments of despair. The push and pull of luck, gods, magic and everything else in the universe guiding them to where they never thought to be. <br /><br />And that’s without talking about the brilliant prose he uses in describing this incredible world. <br />When you blend all that together it redefines the term epic. Perhaps the best book I’ve ever read. Better still………I’ve only finished book two!",5
"I don’t know what to do with these stars anymore. I give stars to books and then I think, ‘god, you give five stars to everything, people will think you are terribly undiscriminating’ – so then I give four stars or even three stars to some books. Then I look back and it turns out that that I’ve given four stars to <i>Of Human Bondage</i> and honestly, how could I possibly have thought it was a good idea to give that book less than five stars? It is the absurdity of human conventions that has us doing such things.<br /><br />Now, that is what is called a segue, from the Italian ‘seguire’ – to follow. <br /><br />For the last thirty years I have studiously avoided reading this book. I have done that because for the last thirty years I have known exactly what this book is about and there just didn’t seem any point in reading it. In high school friends (one of them even became my ex-wife) told me it was a great book about a man condemned to die because he was an outsider. <br /><br />Later I was told that this book was a story about something much like the Azaria Chamberlain case. A case where someone does not react in a way that is considered to be ‘socially appropriate’ and is therefore condemned.<br /><br />But after 30 years of avoiding reading this book I have finally relented and read it. At first I didn’t think I was going to enjoy it. It didn’t really get off to the raciest of starts and the character's voice – it is told in first person – was a bit dull. He is a man who lives entirely in the present, how terribly Buddhist of him – although, really there doesn’t seem to be all that much to him.<br /><br />My opinion of the book began to change at his mother’s funeral. I particularly liked the man who kept falling behind in the march to the cemetery and would take short cuts. Okay, so it is black humour, but Camus was more or less French – so black humour is more or less obligatory.<br /><br />I really hadn’t expected this book to be nearly so funny as it turned out. I’d always been told it was a ponderous philosophical text – and so, to be honest, I was expecting to be bored out of my skull. I wasn’t in the least bit bored.<br /><br />A constant theme in my life at present is that I read ‘classics’ expecting them to be about something and they end up being about something completely different. And given I’ve called this a ‘constant’ theme then you might think I would be less than surprised when a read a new ‘classic’ and it turns out to be completely different to my expectations. I’m a little more upset about this one than some of the others, as I’ve been told about this one before, repeatedly, and by people I’d have taken as ‘reputable sources’ – although, frankly, how well one should trust one’s ex-wife in such matters is moot.<br /><br />I had gotten the distinct impression from all of my previous discussions about this book that the guy ends up dead. In fact, this is not the case – he ends up at the point in his life where he has no idea if he will be freed or not. The Priest who comes to him at the end is actually quite certain that he will be freed. Let’s face it, he is only guilty of having murdered an Arab, and as we have daily evidence, Westerners can murder Arabs with complete impunity. <br /><br />The main point of the book to me is when he realises he is no longer ‘free’. He needs this explained to him – because life up until then had been about ‘getting used to things’ and one can 'get used to just about anything'. But the prison guard helpfully informs him that he is being ‘punished’ and the manifestation of that punishment is the removal of his ‘freedom’. Interestingly, he didn’t notice the difference between his past ‘free’ life and his current ‘unfree’ one. <br /><br />The most interesting part of the book to me was the very end, the conversation with the priest. The religious often make the mistake of thinking that Atheists are one thing – I’ve no idea how they ever came to make this mistake, but make it they do. Given that there are thousands upon thousands of different shades of Christians – from Jesuit Catholics to Anti-Disney Episcopalians – it should be fairly obvious that something like Atheism (without any ‘organised’ church or even system of beliefs) could not be in anyway ‘homogeneous’.<br /><br />I am definitely not the same kind of Atheist as Camus. To Camus there is no truth, the world is essentially absurd and all that exists is the relative truth an individual places on events and ideas. This makes the conversation with the priest fascinatingly interesting. To the priest the prisoner who is facing death is – by necessity – someone who is interested in God. You can play around with ideas like the non-existence of God when it doesn’t seem to matter (life is long and blasphemy can seem fun) – but surely when confronted with the stark truth of the human condition any man would turn away from their disbelief and see the shining light.<br /><br />Not this little black duck. Now, if I was in that cell I would have argued with the priest too – but I would not have argued in the same way that Meursault argues. No, I do not believe in God, but I do believe in truth, and so Camus’ arguments are barred to me.<br /><br />Meursault essentially says, “Look, I’m bored, I’m totally uninterested in the rubbish you are talking – now go away”. Now, this is a reasonable response. What is very interesting is that the priest cannot accept this as an answer. The world is not allowed to have such a person in it – if such a person really did exist then it would be a fundamental challenge to the core beliefs of the priest. So, he has to assume Meursault is either lying to him or is trying to taunt him. But it is much worse – he is absolutely sincere, he is not interested in this ‘truth’.<br /><br />I don’t know that the world is completely meaningless, it is conventional rather than meaningless. That those conventions are arbitrary (decided by the culture we grew up in) doesn’t make them meaningless, it makes them conventional. I don’t think I would like to live in a world where people go up and kill Arabs pretty much at random and with impunity, but then again, we have already established this is precisely the world I do live in. My point is that it would be better if we did adhere to some sort of moral principles and that these should be better principles than ‘he should be killed because he didn’t cry at his mum’s funeral’. <br /><br />Camus is seeking to say that all of our ‘moral principles’ in the end come to be as meaningless as that – we judge on the basis of what we see from the framework of our own limited experience. And look, yes, there is much to this – but this ends up being too easy.<br /><br />The thing I like most about Existentialism, though it isn’t really as evident in this book as it is in the actual philosophy – although this is something that Meursault is supposed to have grown to understand (sorry, just one more sub-clause) even though this wasn’t something I noticed at all while reading the book, was the notion of responsibility. I didn’t think in the end Meursault was all that much more ‘responsible’ for his actions than he had been at the start. But I do think that ‘responsibility’ is a key concept in morality and one that seems increasingly to be ignored.<br /><br />Better by far that we feel responsible for too much in our lives than too little – better by far that we take responsibility for the actions of our governments (say) than to call these governments ‘them’. <br /><br />I’m not advocating believing in <i>The Secret</i> - but that if one must err, better to err on the side of believing you have too much responsibility for how your life has turned out, rather than too little.<br /><br />So, what can I say? I enjoyed this much more than I expected – but I’m still glad I waited before reading it, I really don’t think I would have gotten nearly as much out of it at 15 as I did now.<br />",4

Here are the opening lines: “Mother died today Or, maybe, yesterday; I can’t be sure. The telegram from the Home says: YOUR MOTHER PASSED AWAY. FUNERAL TOMORROW. DEEP SYMPATHY.” <br><br>A telegram, not a personal phone call or someone on staff from the old people’s home actually making the hour trip in person to inform her only son, but a terse three line businesslike telegram – cold, insensitive, almost callous; a telling sign of the mechanized times.<br><br>Then first-person narrator Monsieur Meursault has to deal with his manager so he can attend his mother’s funeral: <br><br>""I have fixed up with my employer for two days’ leave; obviously, under the circumstances, he couldn’t refuse. Still, I had an idea he looked annoyed, and I said, without thinking: 'Sorry, sir, but it’s not my fault, you know.'""<br><br>Ha! Camus’ subtle irony, a statement on how death is an irritating inconvenience in the urbanized modern world of shipping offices, where time is money and the highest value is utility and efficiency.<br><br>Then, when Meursault sits beside the Home’s keeper in the room with his mother’s coffin, we read: <br><br>“The glare of the white walls was making my eyes smart, and I asked him if he couldn’t turn off one of the lamps. “Nothing doing,” he said. 'They’d arranged the lights like that; either one had them all on or none at all.'” <br><br>Most revealing. This is the only time at the Home Meursault actually asks for something. And true to form as archetypal keeper, the answer is standard binary, that is, all or nothing, black or white, on or off; certainly not even considering engaging in a creative solution on behalf of Meursault, who, after all, is the son. Reading this section about the Home’s officious keeper and his world of expected behaviors and standardized, routinized procedures reminds me of the doorkeeper in Kafka’s tale, <i>Before the Law.</i><br><br>The next day, the day of the funeral procession, Meursault observes, “The sky was already a blaze of light, and the air stoking up rapidly. I felt the first waves of heat lapping my back, and my dark suit made things worse. I couldn’t imagine why we waited so long before getting under way.” This is one of a number of his remarks on his sensations and feelings, and, for good reason – Meursault’s way of being in the world is primarily on the level of sensation and feeling.<br><br>Back in the city and after taking a swim with Marie, a girlfriend he ran into at the local swimming pool, there’s a clip of dialogue where Meursault relates: “While we were drying ourselves on the edge of the swimming pool she said: “I’m browner than you.” I asked her if she’d come to the movies with me that evening. She laughed again and said, “Yes,” if I’d take her to the comedy everybody was talking about, the one with Fernandel in it.” Meursault does acquiesce to her request. Big mistake. Turns out, according to society’s unwritten rules, taking Marie to Fernandel’s farcical comedy on the very next evening after his mother’s funeral was a colossal no-no, completely unacceptable behavior.<br><br>We as given laser-sharp glimpses of various facets of our enigmatic first-person narrator as he moves through his everyday routine in the following days and evenings, routine, that is, until the unforgettable scene with the Arab on the beach, one of the most famous scenes in all of modern literature. Here are Camus’ words via Stuart Gilbert’s marvelous translation:<br><br>The Arab didn’t move. After all, there was still some distance between us. Perhaps because of the shadow on his face, he seemed to be grinning at me.<br>I waited. The heat was beginning to scorch my cheeks; beads of sweat were gathered in my eyebrows. It was just the same sort of heat as my mother’s funeral, and I had the same disagreeable sensations – especially in my forehead, where all the veins seemed to be bursting through the skin. I couldn’t stand it an longer, and took another step forward. I knew it was a fool thing to do; I wouldn’t get out of the sun by moving on a yard or so. But I took that step, just one step, forward,. And then the Arab drew his knife and held it up toward me, athwart the sunlight.<br>A shaft of light shot upward from the steel, and I felt as if a long, thin blade transfixed my forehead. At the same moment all the sweat that had accumulated in my eyebrows splashed down on my eyelids, covering them with a warm film of of moisture. Beneath a veil of brine and tears my eyes were blinded; I was conscious only of the cymbals of the sun clashing on my skull, and, less distinctly, of the keen blade of light flashing up from the knife, scarring my eyelashes, and gouging into my eyeballs.<br>Then everything began to reel before my eyes, a fiery gust came from the sea, while the sky cracked in two, from end to end, and a great sheet of flame poured down through the rift. Every nerve in my body was a steel spring, and my grip closed on the revolver. The trigger gave, and the smooth underbelly of the butt jogged my palm.<br><br>This novel poses such provocative questions, I wouldn’t want to spoil any of those questions with answers, semi-original or otherwise. Rather, my suggestion is to read and reread this slim novel as carefully and attentively as possible.<br><br>One last reflection: one of my favorite scenes is where Meursault enters the courtroom and makes the following observation: “Just then I noticed that almost all the people in the courtroom were greeting each other, exchanging remarks and forming groups – behaving, in fact, as in a club where the company of others of one’s own tastes and standing makes one feel at ease. That, no doubt, explained the odd impression I had of being de trop here, a sort of gate-crasher.” Such a comment on the dynamics of the modern world: a man is about to go on trial with his life in the balance and he is the one who feels out-of-place.<br><br>How many times in life have you felt out-of-place entering a room? Have you ever considered yourself a stranger to those around you? Perhaps our modern world can be seen as <i>The Stranger</i>, thus making each and every one of us strangers. Love or hate it, Camus’ short novel speaks to our condition.<br><br>One final reflection: I would not be surprised if Albert Camus read this prose poem by Charles Baudelaire:<br><br><i>THE STRANGER</i><br><br>Tell me, enigmatic man, whom do you love best?

"A short review because there are so many other good reviews of this classic. When I first read this eons ago, I assumed “the stranger” was the Arab man that the main character kills on the beach. (It’s set in Algeria.) Not so. <br><br><img src=""https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1507384101i/24111693._SX540_.jpg"" width=""393"" height=""262"" alt=""description"" class=""gr-hostedUserImg"" loading=""lazy""><br><br>Meursault, the main character, is a man without feelings and one incapable of feeling remorse. Those deficiencies show at his mother’s death when he does not cry and does not even seem terribly upset. They show again when he agrees to write a letter for a friend so that the friend can invite his ex-girlfriend back so he can beat her up. Mostly they are revealed when he shoots a stranger - an Arab – after an altercation on the beach. Five shots: first one, a pause, and then four more. The “four more” is what eventually gets him convicted. <br><br>He lives in a poor, violent neighborhood where, when one man’s wife dies, he starts beating his dog instead of his wife. “As for the dog, he’s sort of taken on his master’s stooped look, muzzle down, neck straining. They look as if they belong to the same species, and yet they hate each other.”<br><br>Meursault has a girlfriend that he likes, but mostly he doesn’t care about her one way or the other. These two passages say it all: “A minute later she asked me if I loved her. I told her it didn’t mean anything but that I didn’t think so. She looked sad.” And “That evening Marie came by to see me and asked me if I wanted to marry her. I said it didn’t make any difference to me and that we could if she wanted to.” <br><br>His boss at a shipping company asks him if he want to be transferred to a job in Paris. “Then he asked me if I wasn’t interested in a change of life. I said that people never change their lives, that in any case one life was as good as another…” <br><br>At his trial for the murder, he feels that the prosecutor and his lawyer are arguing in a way that has nothing to do with him. He has a surge of feeling that he is dying to say something but then thinks “But on second thought, I didn’t have anything to say.” When he’s convicted and sentenced to death, he also acts as if it’s no big deal. “But everybody knows life isn’t worth living….Since we’re all going to die, it’s obvious that when and how don’t matter.”<br><br>The book is a classic early modern work of anomie, alienation and a general indifference to life. It’s also perhaps a spin-off from Crime and Punishment. Today, a novel like this would take us back to Meursault’s childhood to show us why he turned out like this. Camus doesn’t do that, so we can only speculate – or, perhaps, attribute it to genetics. <br><br><img src=""https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1507384334i/24111720._SX540_.jpg"" width=""363"" height=""242"" alt=""description"" class=""gr-hostedUserImg"" loading=""lazy""><br><br>As a classic in English translation a lot has been made of its opening and closing sentences. In the edition I read the first sentence is translated as “Maman died today.” Should it be “Today, mother died?” On the last page is a sentence: “…I opened myself to the gentle indifference of the world.” Should it be instead, “I laid my heart open to the gentle indifference of the universe?” I’m reminded of the review I did of Mogens by Jens Peter Jacobsen where the foreword tells us that the author felt it would be a different story if it began “It was summer,” rather than “Summer it was…” Still a great classic. <br><br>Beni Said Beach from skyscrapercity.com<br>Photo of the author from port-magazine.com<br>",5
"The book is simply written and a rather quick read, but the depth Camus manages to convey through this simplicity is astounding. I think a problem a lot of people have with this book is that they fail to look beyond the whole ""what is the meaning of life"" message. While an interesting question, the book raises so many other philosophical questions beyond this. What I found the most interesting of these is ""what truly defines humanity or makes someone human?"" During Meursault's trial, he is constantly accused of not showing remorse and therefore as being cold and inhuman. He is most definitely human though, just rather detached. This raises the question of whether one should be expected to exhibit certain characteristics in certain situations to ""keep their humanity"". <br /><br />Also it raises the question of whether much of our emotion is created by ourselves or the expectations of others to exhibit certain emotions in a given sitatuion. The book is also an indictment on people's efforts to dictate other people's lives. We are constantly told what is right and as a means to justify our own sense of ""what it means to be human"". We often impose these characteristics upon others, expecting them to fulfill similar traits and characteristics, as they have been already imposed on us. It is in a way, a self-justification of our actions as right or ""humanly"". Constantly, Meursault is being told he must live and/or act a certain way, whether it be by the judge, his lawyer, or the priest. Once he doesn't conform to these measures, he is marginalized and called ""inhuman""; this is an attempt on the part of the others to rationalize their own ways of life and understandings. If they manage to declare him ""inhuman"", it allows them to call themselves human and justify their own means of living.<br /><br />In the end, this book is one that raises many more questions than it answers, but in true philosophical fashion, they are really questions without answers.

y'know it's quite impressive that Camus managed to write a whole novel from the perspective of that guy who you always avoid at house parties.,3
"<b>If You Exist</b><br /><br />""The Stranger"" dramatises the issues at the heart of existentialism.<br /><br />The same issues are probably at the heart of life, whether or not you believe in a god.<br /><br /><b>Being Judged</b><br /><br />It's interesting that there has been a crime and now Meursault is being ""judged"".<br /><br />The judgement is symbolic not only of the justice system, but of God's judgement of humanity.<br /><br /><b>Defending Yourself</b><br /><br />You would normally expect the defendant to assert their innocence or plead not guilty in the criminal justice system (cue Law and Order theme song).<br /><br />Both options require the defendant to take a positive step, only they differ in degree.<br /><br />To assert your ""innocence"" is to positively state that ""I didn't do it"".<br /><br />A plea of ""not guilty"" would place an onus on the prosecutor to prove the defendant's guilt (although there are significant differences between the French system of justice and that of the UK/USA/Canada/Australia/etc).<br /><br />To plead not guilty can mean a number of things.<br /><br />It could mean that ""I did actually do it"", but you, the prosecutor, have to prove to the Judge or Court that I did it.<br /><br />It could mean that ""I did actually do it"", but I have a defence or justification that means it is not a punishable crime (e.g., self-defence or provocation).<br /><br /><b>Asking Forgiveness</b><br /><br />This process is partly analogous to the situation when a Christian dies and meets their God.<br /><br />If they have sinned, you would expect them to ask forgiveness.<br />Having been forgiven, they would expect to go to Heaven.<br /><br /><b>Not Defending Yourself</b><br /><br />One of the dilemmas of ""The Stranger"" is that morally and legally there might be issues that Meursault could put to the Judge that would excuse his action and allow the Judge to find him not guilty.<br /><br />He could then go ""free"".<br /><br />He could have argued that his action was self-defence or the result of provocation.<br /><br />He could have ""got off"", if he had taken a positive step on his own behalf. However, he fails to take the step.<br /><br />If he was a Christian (i.e., if he believed in God), he might have wanted to prolong his life on Earth.<br /><br />His life would have had some meaning and he would have wanted more of it.<br /><br />Similarly, if he was a Christian, he would have been motivated to seek eternal life in Heaven.<br /><br />So he would have taken the positive step.<br /><br /><b>What's the Point?</b><br /><br />Instead, against all expectation, he doesn't defend himself. We are left to wonder why.<br /><br />We have to assume that Meursault effectively asked the questions of himself, ""What is the point? Why should I bother?""<br /><br />And we have to assume that he answered the questions, ""There is no point"".<br /><br /><b>Achieving Your Own Mortality</b><br /><br />There was no point in prolonging his life and, not believing in Heaven, there was no point in seeking eternal life.<br /><br />He had lived a life (however long or short, however good or bad, however satisfying or unsatisfying) and it didn't really matter that his life might come to an end.<br /><br />The point is that, sooner or later, all life must come to an end.<br /><br />By failing to take a ""positive"" step on his own behalf, he effectively collaborated in and achieved his own mortality. He existed while he was alive, he would have ceased to exist when he was executed.<br /><br />If he wasn't executed, he would have died sooner or later.<br /><br />Ultimately, he ""enjoyed"" his life while he had it, he didn't care enough to prolong it and he accepted the inevitability of his own death.<br /><br /><b>Is Despair the Explanation?</b><br /><br />This doesn't necessarily mean that he embraced despair as a way of life (or death).<br /><br />In a way, he accepted responsibility for his own actions during life and he accepted responsibility for the inevitability of his own death as well.<br /><br />Ultimately, this is why ""The Stranger"" and Existentialism are so confronting to Christianity and Western Civilisation. It makes us ask the question ""what is the point?"" and it permits an answer that ""there is no point"".<br /><br /><b>Responsibility</b><br /><br />This doesn't mean that life is meaningless and everybody else should live their lives in despair. Quite the opposite.<br /><br />We should inject our own meaning into our own lives. We are responsible for our own fulfilment.<br /><br />Life is short and we should just get on with it. (Or as a friend of mine says, everybody is responsible for their own orgasm.)<br /><br />Such is life.<br /><br /> ",5
"‘<i>It was like knocking four quick times on the door of unhappiness.</i>’<br /><br />Even if we exist in a world devoid of meaning, why is it that our actions still bear so much weight? The crime and punishment of Nobel Prize winning author Albert Camus’ academically canonized <i>The Stranger</i> depicts the ironies of enforcing meaning in a void and the absurdities that surround us as humans walking towards the same cold, lifeless fate. ‘<i>Since we're all going to die,</i>’ writes narrator Meursault, ‘<i>it's obvious that when and how don't matter.</i>’ Yet, when and how define a life, especially when the the why is a direct consequence of a life lived, though do our lives truly matter at all? These questions rattle across the pages of this fantastic character study revolving around a courtroom character judgement of the narrator, a courtroom of suits flanking a judge that might as well be angels flanking the pearly gates of Christian lore. <i>The Stranger</i> is a lesson in absurdity and investigative analysis of a life faced with the ‘<i>benign indifference of the world</i>’.<br /><br />‘<i>There is not love of life without despair about life.</i>’<br /><br />Meursault is a man of few words or convictions beyond those that choices rarely make much difference in the grand scheme of the world. Yet it is his choices that damn him in this world, especially by those who believe that his actions damn him in a next world that probably doesn’t even exist according to our narrator. While most decisions really don’t amount to much of a difference, there are still those which inevitably set life in different directions, such as to pull the trigger or not to pull the trigger, ‘<i>To stay or to go, it amounted to the same thing</i>’. This is a man not unsatisfied with life but feeling on the outside of it, moving through the world as he sees fit, and being denied life by men with a God-like arrogance for believing their word and opinions are firm law when really they are as meaningless and insignificant as any other creature. However, this is not a story of the condemners, but of the condemned. It is important to note that Meursault is, for all intents and purposes, an ‘everyman’, one that exists in all of us even if we surpress or deny it. ‘<i>I felt the urge to reassure him that I was like everybody else, just like everybody else,</i>’ and it isn’t Meursault on trial, but all of us. It is the collective human soul with all our errors, intentional or not, on trial for existing in a world that probably doesn’t matter or care.<br /><br />‘<i>Maman died today,</i>’¹ begins <i>The Stranger</i>’, an event setting everything into motion. Part One of the novel focuses on the funeral, and more importantly its aftermath. As we watch Meursault awkwardly press through a funeral he feels detached from, more inclined to discuss how the weather and present company ill-effect him than the loss of a mother.<blockquote>
  <i>It occurred to me anyway that one more Sunday was over, that Maman was buried now that I was going back to work, and that, really, nothing had changed.</i>
</blockquote>Following the funeral <i>The Stranger</i> chronicles Meursault’s relations with the living and the natural world, most critically concerning his courtship of Marie. Marie, it would seem, figures as an Oedipal substitute for his Maman². Whereas the relationship with Maman is cold and detached, the two of them separating much out of boredom with one another, his relationship with Marie is full of excitement and hot-blooded sexual flair, yet the text is full of imagery nudging towards Oedipal impulses. There is a fixation with her breasts, which are frequently mentioned and sought after by the motherless Meursault, or the tender moment when he seeks out Marie’s scent on the pillow and falls asleep in the warm embrace of bed and scent, a fairly childlike and soul-bearing act. <br /><br />Meursault’s relationships lead him down a path that ends with senseless murder (as senseless as everything else may be a question worth considering), and while we put a moral weight on the difference between intentionally pulling the trigger or the trigger going off from being overcome by the sun and heat, is there truly any difference at all since both lead to a body bleeding out on the beach? This murder, and the absolutely brilliant final line of ‘<i>knocking four quick times on the door of unhappiness</i>’—one of my favorites in all of literature—propels the reader into Part Two. Here we have find Meursault denied the sunsoaked scenes of nature and friendship of the outside world, and the sexuality so rampant in part one as he finds himself now beset by the cold indifferent stone walls of prison. The world of part one only whispers through the bars. There is still the overwhelming warmth, but this is more akin to hellfire in a judgement scene where mortal flesh takes on the role of an Almighty judge in an investigation of Meursault’s character. Meursault describes the utter absurdity of being the true focus of the trial, but being forced to sit silent as others do all the deciding and discussing as if he didn’t matter one bit. It also seems strange that the murder is not the primary discussion, but the actions of relations leading up to it. Did Meursault love his mother, was he in the circle of criminals, and other moral characteristics of the man seem to be the deciding factor of his fate, a trial that reads like a Holy decision into either Heaven or Hell while actually being a decision that would remove him from this worldly courtroom to the immortal courtroom, if that is to be believed (certainly by the lawyers but denied by Meursault).<blockquote>
  <i>I realized then that a man who had lived only one day could easily live for a hundred years in prison. He would have enough memories to keep him from being bored.</i>
</blockquote>Being left with only having your past life, full of its joys and transgressions, to either comfort or haunt you for what feels like eternity reads much like an expression of an afterlife. If there is one, then life has meaning, but what if there isn’t one and we don’t have to atone for our actions?<br /><br />‘<i>It is better to burn than to disappear.</i>’<br /><br /><i>The Stranger</i> is a probing look into the folds of existence, and one that forces you to consider your own life and it’s place under all those indifferent stars. The writing is crisp and immediate, and the effect is nearly overwhelming and all-encompassing in its beauty and insight. I read this in high school and have now re-read it in preparation for <a href=""https://goodreads.com/book/show/25263557.The_Meursault_Investigation"" title=""The Meursault Investigation by Kamel Daoud"" rel=""noopener"">The Meursault Investigation</a>. I found it to be much more meaningful to me as an adult as I found it then, though I enjoyed it equally both times. When a reader is young, the ideas seem engaging and attractive, but more like a hat one can put on and remove when they are done and move on. As an adult, having been through much more and having experienced bleak moments and bottom-of-the-well nights where life truly felt absurd and devoid of meaning or warmth, Meursault didn’t seem so distant or theoretical but like a life we’ve all lived and tried to forget. <i>The Stranger</i> has earned it’s place in the literary canon as well as deep within my heart.<br /><br /><b>4.5/5</b><br /><br />‘<i>I felt that I had been happy and that I was happy again. For everything to be consummated, for me to feel less alone, I had only to wish that there be a large crowd of spectators the day of my execution and that they greet me with cries of hate.</i>’<br /><br />¹ There is a <a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/lost-in-translation-what-the-first-line-of-the-stranger-should-be"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">fascinating article</a> from the New Yorker discussing the various translations of the opening line. I tend to prefer their own version, which has never been put into the novel that it should read ‘Today, Maman died’ as Meursault exists in the here and now, and that the death of his mother is an interruption of his ‘today’, which should be first and foremost as in the original French ‘<i>Aujourd’hui, maman est morte</i>’, especially since placing Maman first assumes a closeness to her that doesn’t present itself through the rest of the novel. Note as well the quote above where Sunday passing is placed before mention of burying his mother.<br /><br />² Is it possible, too, that the absence of Maman reflects the absence of God?<br /><br />How could I neglect to mention the song <a href=""www.youtube.com/watch?v=SdbLqOXmJ04"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Killing an Arab</a> by the Cure, inspired by this novel.",5
"“Camus, you have a Beautiful Soul!”<br /><br />So conceded Albert Camus’ longtime friend, confidante, and fellow agent provocateur, Jean-Paul Sartre, at the time of the much-publicized rift that ended their felicitous comradeship.<br /><br />Well, and you know what? Camus always had something Sartre didn’t - a warm, caring HUMANNESS.<br /><br />THAT’s why everyone who reads this book admires it. Camus was for REAL.<br /><br />Camus, like so many mid-century existentialists, was alienated from traditional societal roles and structures.<br /><br />But, unlike them - and so many of us - he WASN’T alienated from his Real SELF!<br /><br />That’s because, unlike Sartre, he didn’t live in his Head. He lived in his Soul, which, in becoming a persona non grata, knew positive LIBERATION from his Self. <br /><br />Because he knew the phony Self to be only the Origin of Darkness.<br /><br />But like Sartre and Beckett, though himself Algerian, he learned his lessons under the Vichy French. “Et les soldats faisent la haie?” Then throw sand in their faces! Liberté, fraternité, égalité all the way...<br /><br />But politics divides, as our essential humanity unifies, and it is on the latter quality that I’ll focus, for Camus was essentially a voice for Unification.<br /><br />This novel is about one man’s reentry into his Humanity. Much MORE than about Life’s meaninglessness. <br /><br />And for Camus, too, I think, who might just have said:<br />That is not what I mean to say at all...<br />(for) It is IMPOSSIBLE to say just what I mean!<br /><br />But though it is notoriously difficult to communicate it, Camus had found his Answer in the end: <br /><br />That the clear and calm Eye of the Storm is right at the centre of its fury.<br /><br />Once you see that, it is enough.<br /><br />Just look at the old B&amp;W stills of him at the height of his fame - surrounded by cooing coeds! Doesn’t seem much to me like he wasn’t loving his life...<br /><br />But I guess maybe - just maybe - before his own, much like Merseault’s, existential somersault (his hero’s takes place in the blinding glare of the dry sun that hot day on the beach), he was just an automaton. <br /><br />Look at that devilish grimace on his young face, cigarette dangling rebelliously from his scowling lips, in that infamous early mug shot!<br /><br />Going vaguely through the motions. Like so many of us, if we are still in the workforce. Not much giving a darn. About anything.<br /><br />I too was a robot - till the day I retired. That was the day all my chickens came home to roost. <br /><br />You know, someone who is still working said to my wife that it’s best to keep busy when you retire - so your mind won’t wander.<br /><br />I got news for that person. <br /><br />It wanders willy-nilly - all by itself. Stop it, and you’ll slowly shrivel up and die.<br /><br />But there’s one thing you can do. <br /><br />You can always try to connect the dots, slowly and patiently. Remember E.M Forster’s Howards End? “Only connect!” Recover your Lost Humanity.<br /><br />Well, that’s what I did - and what happened to Merseault that day on the beach, happened to me, sitting on my rocking chair. A huge prise de conscience. <br /><br />All at once, it fell into place.<br /><br />I wasn’t mad, most Noble Festus, no - but my two feet were back on the ground for the first time in ages. I was free.<br /><br />And alive.<br /><br />For we are all part of a Huge and Vibrant Human Reality in the midst of whose ceaseless action is the only Peace that’s real.<br /><br />And that’s what happened to Merseault, and so what did he do?<br /><br />He “sang in his chains like the Sea!”<br /><br />For -<br /><br />Imprisoned, he is now Human..<br /><br />Condemned, he’s now Alive.<br /><br />He has the inestimable freedom of the Eternal Present Moment of his Life...<br /><br />And NOBODY can take it away from him.",5
"If every few words of praise I’ve seen for “The Stranger” over my lifetime materialized into small chunks of rock in space, there’d be enough sh!t to conjure up the Oort Cloud. Much like this distant collection of debris bordering the outer solar system, I can’t really comprehend the acclaim heaped on this story, but luckily, like the Cloud, it’s usually out of sight, out of mind, and has absolutely no discernable current influence on my life. And just like the Oort can occasionally spit a chunk of sh!t at the earth and devastate all life upon it, so too can I hear/read some lip service paid to “The Stranger” resulting in my transition to Freak-Out Mode, resulting in me slapping someone in the face, usually someone I have to deal with again at some point in time (if only in court).<br /><br />	Personally, I don’t see what the big deal is. Armed with a 100-word vocabulary, a meager 123 pages to bore one with, and a character who simply doesn’t seem to give much of a damn, Camus somehow shook the world of literature with this inane garbage. I haven’t sat down to conduct a thorough analysis, but using some reasonable guesstimation I will say that the average sentence in this book is about eight words long. I’m not asking that every sentence in a book run the length of a page, but the end result when employed by Camus was that either a twelve year old or some sort of retarded robot wrote this. (Cue robot voice) It struck me as strange. The sentences were so short. It was very peculiar. This could be read very fast. I began to read this on the train on my in to work. I finished it on my way back home. <br /><br />	Who the hell writes like that? More importantly, who the hell reads a book like that and suspects therein lay some complexity? Each time I noticed how condensed everything was it occurred to me that somehow the literati had spent all this time adoring the published equivalent of a commercial. <br /><br />	Here’s a snapshot of the dude we’re supposed to give a hoot about. He doesn’t readily assimilate to or accept the conventional mores everyone else seems accustomed to. He’s not overly concerned, but he seemingly knows there’s some kind of disconnect. He’s also not out to go f#ck with the system for lack of anything better to do or in some attempt to make a statement. He’s pretty emotionless, he shows some genuine concern for himself at times, but even those close to him really aren’t too significant in his grand picture. His testicles are extremely small and sterile, and he fondles them often.<br /><br />	Not long after the death of his mother, Our Hero is chilling on the beach when some Arabs come around looking to start sh!t with an acquaintance of his, and after a small skirmish earlier in the day, Our Man goes back down to the beach and shoots an Arab. He gets arrested and pretty much just goes with the flow, he rolls over and let’s the prosecution have their way with his scrawny white ass. The whole time he pretty much just thinks it’s all pretty ridiculous and isn’t too concerned with the proceedings.<br /><br />	I wasn’t too concerned about the book. More than anything I was just bored with it. There was no build up, there was no action, there was no climax. There was nothing funny, nothing exciting, nothing interesting, and nothing to really take away from the book; just the same words repeating over and over, grouped in strings of seven or eight. The longest sentence in the book was also the only thing which I found even remotely amusing: “Finally I realized that some of the old people were sucking at the insides of their cheeks and making these weird smacking noises”. That isn’t particularly funny, but compared to the rest of the book it was comedic gold. <br /><br />	“The Stranger” is some seriously weak shit. I’ve gotten more enjoyment from looking a map of Kentucky.<br />",1

"I just finished reading this famous - classic story. All this time I had no idea what it was about. <br /><br />What an interesting little book. I enjoyed reading in the same way that I have <br />""Siddartha"", by Herman Hesse, or ""The Alchemist"", by Paulo Coelho. <br /><br />It's a brilliant small book - especially knowing it was written so long ago: 1942..... but it's timeless. <br /><br />Is everything the same as everything else? Does it matter who we marry or if we marry? Does it matter if we live or die? Must murder have a meaning? <br /><br />Whose challenge is it when a person's behavior- is much less traditional than popular opinion? His? Or...everyone else around him? <br /><br />And who decides what is meaningful and purposeful in life anyway? Is it possible things are simply 'made up'.... and then we agree what is more important than something else? <br /><br />This book reminds me- ""that life is a game"". It is what it is. The game is how we play it: <br />we add our beliefs - thoughts - feelings - choices. We 'add' meaning to ""what is"". <br /><br />Life is interpretation.... and Camus's main character, Meursault, doesn't blindly accept conventional meaning which is often impose on the world. He accepts his fate - yet not passively. He's clear he did something wrong. He's expecting others to be outraged. It accepts it all. <br /><br />So... we, the reader, are left to draw many of our own conclusions-or not -but we are certainly invited to take a look at the deeper meaning of life. <br /><br />Love the simple straightforward prose.....and personally I found Meursault charming and likable. I liked his strangeness! <br />",5
"The Stranger by Camus - which I picked up randomly from my library - is a classic of the 20th century, and I had never read it. Why? I do not know. Just as I did not know, or even nothing, precisely what this masterpiece of contemporary literature concealed.<br />The discovery was, therefore, complete. And that's what I like when I tackle real work. To know nothing about it, expect nothing, be guided only by its author, and experience only my feelings without previously being driven by outside opinions.<br />I was taken aback by these short, jerky, cold sentences that didn't betray emotion from the first pages. How well seen from Camus! Because, through his pen, it is his Meursault who expresses himself, who tells himself, who tells us.<br />Camus very cleverly withdrew, so he left me alone with Meursault. And, nothing to do. I can't feel<br />sympathy, empathy, or even antipathy for this guy. He is impenetrable. He leaves me outside. The wall he has erected between him and me is impassable, even worse, between him and me.<br />As Meursault recounts, I learned Alexithymia is a term that existed long ago in particular circumstances.<br />Alexithymia is a personality construct characterized by the inability to identify and describe emotions in oneself. Individuals suffering from this dysfunction also find it difficult to distinguish and appreciate the feelings of others, which leads to a hopeless and ineffective psychological response.<br />Here is the drama of Meursault. He is a stranger. Stranger to himself. Stranger to others. Stranger to life. A stranger to everything. He passes and does pass. He walks past us, next to himself. Like a breath.

"The Stranger by Albert Camus, though quite regarded by many as a great philosophical/existentialist novel (I'm gonna be a non-conformist here.) is not quite right for me. I'm really quite at odds here. Before anything else, I would like to state that I was rather pleased with the first half of the novel, but sadly not by the second. Sure, this novella exposes certain absurdities in our society. I'd agree to that. But for me, the truths that this book expounds upon is not enough to make up for the negativeness that it entails upon its readers. <br /><br />In the way that I understand it, one of the point of his message in the end states that: What we do is not important, because we will all perish anyway. Why invest in morality, in relations, in feelings, when all that awaits us is certain death? Sure, life can be absurd at times. Sure, we'll all die. But just because of these known realities, should we throw away things that make sense? Throw away our life? Should the negative destroy the positive? It comes to me like this. Because we urinate what we drink, then it doesn't matter whether we drink muddy water or urine or orange juice. We'll all urinate them later just the same. Sick. Why do we live? Do we live because there might be a slight chance of immortality? Do we live because everything makes sense? We live in-spite of everything. We live because we do. Our consciousness is being insulted, our intelligence trampled, and our life spit-upon by this very grim way of thinking. His insistence that one can just about get used to anything shows man's innate capability to adjust. That we plow on through obstacles and hardships. That we fight even if we encounter difficulties and absurdities. He suggests we shouldn't. That we lay useless and wait for death. Not for me. Go do that yourself. His very pessimistic and rather narrow way of looking at life and death rather pissed me off. <br /><br />Secondly, the very glaring message of indifference rather fires back against Camus's message of non-conformity. You see, indifference, transforms a person in a passive state. And this passive state will easier conform to the norms of society than resist. Personally for me, it is the worst kind of attitude that a person can attain. Intellectually, Camus makes a point. But in the real world, indifference is what destroys this planet. Indifference causes global warming, causes pollution, causes mass extinction. People who don't care are more dangerous than crazy people. Why? Because there are few really crazy people, but there are billions of people who simply don't give a shit. Hitler was mad as hell, all the German soldiers were just indifferent. Indifference is tricky because you're stranded in a solid state of passivity and it's very hard to sway you from one view to another. A person who thinks that littering is good is better than a person who doesn't care if he litters. At least, the former can be persuaded to change his views, but the latter won't under any circumstances. Indifference is a problem without a solution. And this particular message is the worst for me. <br /><br />Now, we've come to a part where I partly agree with Camus but still not quite. That no matter what truths are, all that matters is what each individual's personal choice is. That we shouldn't impose upon others. He equips Meursault with a sort of a Moral Relativism belief (that truths are essentially based on each person's paradigms/cultures/construct) while the Priest that of Moral Realism (that truths are based on a certain definite, universal set). He uses this clash of beliefs to set a stage for his final act and I expected/wanted a rather different outcome. I was rather disappointed. I agree that Meursault found some sort of solitude in losing hope, in his final indifference. But I expected Meursault to find some sort of closure in the acceptance of death as a necessary and meaningful event. That death allows us to appreciate life. I expected that in the end even though I knew it had no chance of happening. The surrealist/existentialist Camus would never do that. But I never expected that it would be as grim and bleak as it was. <br /><br />“Nothing, nothing mattered, and I knew why. So did he. Throughout the whole absurd life I'd lived, a dark wind had been rising toward me from somewhere deep in my future, across years that were still to come, and as it passed, this wind leveled whatever was offered to me at the time, in years no more real than the ones I was living. What did other people's deaths or a mother's love matter to me; what did his God or the lives people choose or the fate they think they elect matter to me when we're all elected by the same fate, me and billions of privileged people like him who also called themselves my brothers? Couldn't he see, couldn't he see that? Everybody was privileged. There were only privileged people. The others would all be condemned one day. And he would be condemned, too.”<br /><br />I ate, but I wasn't nourished. I was poisoned. ",1
"Mersault is a twenty-something clerk of great intelligence but no ambition, little expressed emotion and the attitude of why bother about everything there's nothing wrong with the status quo. But if pushed, by his girlfriend into marriage he will go along with it. Or when his violent pimp of a neighbour wants him to compose a letter to his mistress that is meant to result in extreme nastiness towards her (but backfires), he will act. It's as if inertia is his default. The only time he really shows emotion is when he is annoyed at the heat and glare of the sun, a major annoyance for such a commonplace event. It's the only time he acts of his own volition too. <br /><br />His crime: Mersault is on the beach where he had been invited by his friend, the pimp, and sees one of the Arabs, brother to his friend's ex-mistress. The Arab has just stabbed his friend after the pimp attacked him. Mersault stares at him, he is annoyed to see him and annoyed that the sun is so hot, as hot as it was at his mother's funeral and it annoyed him then too, upset him more than his mother's death. The Arab flashes a knife. Mersault remembers he has the pimp's gun he took to prevent violence, and he shoots him. Then a few seconds later, he shoots the dead body four times more.<br /><br />He is arrested. Once he has adjusted to prison life, he finds that he gets pleasure from his memories and looking at the small square patch of blue sky he can see from his cell. He says that if a person had one day only of freedom, it would create enough memories to live on for the rest of their life. But freedom or imprisonment, it's all the same to him. He is sure things will go his way.<br /><br />He refuses to help his lawyer, denies the existence of god, has no belief in Jesus and shows no remorse at all. It is all the same to him. This, here and now, is all there is, he says, but although he says that, he wants more. Too late, the death knell rings and at the last moment he expresses emotion. When he is led to the guillotine he wants there to be a large and noisy crowd of people who hate him. The same people who were bemused that a law-abiding clerk could commit such a senseless, such an absurd murder. What is the purpose of this angry crowd? Why does he want them there? How else, without religion, can he expiate his sin?<br /><br />Mersault is finely-drawn as one who watches but whose participation is limited to when it suits him. His lack of emotion means he is not immersed in situations, throwing his whole self into things as the very emotional people around him do. These people, his late mother's aged fiance, the pimp, his angry boss, the girlfriend who loves him, the mistress who fights back, the Arabs full of thoughts of revenge, the religious lawyer, are full of passion. But he is the outsider. He observes much and acts little. Except for the once.<br /><br />Existentialism is, it isn't a philosophical choice, and Mersault, while holding those views, doesn't do so through conviction or acceptance, but more because of his damaged personality. Perhaps that is why Camus denied this was an existentialist book.<br /><br />5 stars, plus 2 extra for genius writing and the strength of emotional involvement of the reader, or this reader at least.",5
"4.5…maybe 5 stars?!? Wow, this book is a gentle punch in the face.",4
"The Stranger was first published by Albert Camus in the original French in 1942. <br><br>I cannot help comparing the hollowness, the emptiness in Meursault’s soul to the soldier in Hemingway’s short story “<a href=""https://goodreads.com/book/show/12460367.Soldier_s_Home"" title=""Soldier's Home by Ernest Hemingway"" rel=""noopener"">Soldier's Home</a>”. But in that story, Hemingway describes a change from the war and his reactions are connected with his recent martial experiences. <br><br>Camus makes no mention of Meursault’s past experience, his emptiness is fundamental to his soul, and his reaction is to the world in general. Camus introduces us to his ideas about absurdity, abut how futile it is for us to try, desperately and mostly irrationally, to make sense out of the universe, to try and parcel out a small lot of order amidst a sea of chaos. <br><br>Such ideas of family, justice, religion and nationality appear in Camus’ perspective to be pale and insignificant abstractions in a furnace like hell of indifference. <br><br>The closing scenes between Meursault and the priest are in rare, high and thin air in the world of literature and I could only think of the final confrontation between Raskolnikov and Porfiry in Dostoyevsky’s <a href=""https://goodreads.com/book/show/7144.Crime_and_Punishment"" title=""Crime and Punishment by Fyodor Dostoyevsky"" rel=""noopener"">Crime and Punishment</a> for an adequate comparison. <br><br>This is a short and easy read, but heavy with inference and provocation.<br><br><img src=""https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1556974235i/27455882._SY540_.jpg"" width=""315"" height=""400"" alt=""description"" class=""gr-hostedUserImg"" loading=""lazy"">",4

    <i>“Since we're all going to die, it's obvious that when and how don't matter.” </i>
  </u>
</b> <br /><br />The protagonist, Meursault, just doesn’t give a fuck about anything. He just doesn’t care; he is totally indifferent about where he is and who he is with, and it’s terrifying. He has no emotional responses. He is, without a doubt, dead inside. He can’t feel and he cannot empathise. He lives in the now, utterly unable to comprehend tomorrow or the past: he simply exists in the moment, experiencing all that his senses can detect. And those senses are limited to his own physical sensations. <br /><br />He murders because the sun is in his eyes. He attends his mother’s funeral and all he can think about is his own tiredness and need for sleep. His fiancé greets him with love in her eyes and he doesn’t see a person, all he sees is a pair of tits. That’s it, whenever she comes near him all he remarks on is the shape of her breasts. She is just a body to him, a means for him to sate his own bodily needs. He cannot understand that she has emotions and that his cold behaviour will affect them. And this makes me think he may be somewhere on the autism spectrum, an extreme pole of the autism spectrum I should say. He struggles socially and engages in a lot of preformative behaviour simply saying things because he must: it is required of him. He doesn’t understand the feelings of others, offering only indifferent comments that are unintentionally cold and quite hurtful to those he speaks to. <br /><br />Though in depicting such a character, Albert Camus has opened one of the biggest literary mysteries of all time: what happened to this man? Why is he like this? We see his story in its endgame, but there are no mentions as to why he is so detached. Was he born this way? Is this an extreme case of a social disorder? Did someone break his heart? What ever happened to him? I could speculate about this all day. There are so many possible answers, and so many ways a man could become so lifeless. In a way, he reminded me of an awkward child or teen. He has no voice and no way of forming his own opinions or conversation. He’s just drifting through life, acting the motions he doesn’t really understand.<br /><br />And in such it’s reminiscent of Kafka’s work. It’s certainly more normal. There’s no sense of the macabre or unusual, but there is a sense of detachment, alienation and the feeling of loneliness in an overbearing world. In a way, the book has an almost haunting like quality to it. Well, it certainly has left me feeling unnerved and puzzled as I ponder over what caused such a situation. Meursault just seemed a little bit lost to me, different to all those around him with his introverted personality. He seemed trapped, living in a world he cannot fully comprehend or relate to. <br /><br /><i>The Outsider</i> is a very strong piece of writing; however, it is ever so subtle. It lacks a certain power and purpose. Some readers think Meursault’s lack of conformity was purposeful, a refusal to be like everyone else and experience the same emotions, though I see him as more of a victim of his own terrible coldness: it’s simply who he is, and this is the story of how he suffered because of it.<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.fantasybookreview.co.uk/reviewers/Sean-Barrs.html"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">FBR</a> | <a href=""https://twitter.com/BookdragonSean"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Twitter</a> | <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/FantasyBookReview/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Facebook</a> | <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/sean_barrs24/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Insta</a> | <a href=""https://york.academia.edu/SeanBarrs"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Academia</a>",4

"<u>
  <b>In Search of Lost Time</b>
</u><br /><br /><i>The Stranger</i> is a perplexing book: on the surface, the story and writing are simple and straightforward; yet what exactly lies underneath this surface is difficult to decipher. We can all agree that it is a philosophical novel; yet many readers, I suspect, are left unsure what the philosophical lesson was. This isn’t one of Aesop’s fables. Yes, Camus hits you over the head with <i>something</i>; but the hard impact makes it difficult to remember quite <i>what</i>.<br />		<br />After a long and embarrassingly difficult reread (I’d decided to struggle through the original French this time), my original guess as to the deeper meaning of this book was confirmed: this is a book about time. It is, I think, an allegorical exploration of how our experience of time shapes who we are, what we think, and how we live.<br />		<br />Time is highlighted in the very first sentence: Meursault isn’t quite sure what day his mother passed. Then, he makes another blunder in requesting two days off for the funeral, instead of one—for he forgot that the weekend was coming. How old was his mother when she died? Meursault isn’t sure. Clearly, time is a problem for this fellow. What sort of a man is this, who doesn’t keep track of the days of the week or his mother’s age? What does he think about, then?<br />		<br />For the first half of the book, Meursault is entirely absorbed in the present moment: sensations, desires, fleeting thoughts. He thinks neither of the past nor of the future, but only of what’s right in front of him. This is the root of his apathy. When you are absolutely absorbed in the present, the only things that can occupy your attention are bodily desires and passing fancies. Genuine care or concern, real interest of any kind, is dependent on a past and a future: in our past, we undergo experiences, develop affections, and emotionally invest; and these investments, in turn, shape our actions—we tailor our behavior to bring us closer to the things we care about. Without ever thinking of the past or the future, therefore, our life is a passing dream, a causeless chaos that dances in front of our eyes. <br />		<br />This is reflected in the language Camus uses. As Sartre noted, “The sentences in <i>The Stranger</i> are islands. We tumble from sentence to sentence, from nothingness to nothingness.” By this, Sartre merely wishes to highlight one aspect of Meursault’s thought-process, as mirrored in Camus’s prose: it avoids all causal connection. One thing happens, another thing happens, and then a third thing. This is why Camus so often sounds like Hemingway in this book: the clipped sentences reflect the discontinuous instants of time that pass like disjointed photographs before the eyes of Meursault. There is no making sense of your environment when you are residing in the immediate, for making sense of anything requires abstraction, and abstraction requires memory (how can you abstract a quality from two separate instances if you cannot hold the two instances in your mind at once?).<br />		<br />Now, the really disturbing thing, for me, is how easily Meursault gets along in this condition. He makes friends, he has a job, he even gets a girlfriend; and for quite a long time, at least, he didn’t get into trouble. Yet the reader is aware that Meursault is, if not a sociopath, at least quite close to being one. So how is he getting along so well? This, I think, is the social critique hidden in this book. <br /><br />Meursault lives a perfectly conventional life; for a Frenchman living in Algeria during this time, his life could hardly be more ordinary. This is no coincidence; because he's not interested in or capable of making decisions, Meusault has simply fallen into the path provided for him by his society. In fact, Meursault's society had pre-fabricated everything a person might need, pre-determining his options to such an extent that he could go through life without ever making a decision. Meursault got along so well without having to make decisions because he was never asked to make one. Every decision was made by convention, every option conscribed by custom. If Meursault had not been locked up, chances are he would have simply married Marie. Why? Because that’s what one does.<br />		<br />So Camus lays out a problem: custom prevents us from thinking by circumscribing our decisions. But Camus does not only offer a diagnoses; he prescribes a solution. For this, we must return to the subject of time. When Meursault gets imprisoned, he is at first unhappy because he is no longer able to satisfy his immediate desires. He has been removed from society and from its resources. This produces a fascinating change in him: instead of being totally absorbed in the present moment, Meursault begins to cultivate a sense of the past. He explores his memories. For the first time, he is able, by pure force of will, to redirect his attention from what is right in front of him to something that is distant and gone. He now has a present and a past; and his psychology develops a concomitant depth. The language gets less jerky towards the end, and more like a proper narrative.<br />		<br />This real breakthrough, however, doesn’t happen until Meursault is forced to contemplate the future; and this, of course, happens when he is sentenced to death. His thoughts are suddenly flung towards some future event—the vanishing of his existence. Thus, the circle opened at the beginning is closed at the end, with a perfect loop: the novel ends with a hope for what will come, just as it began with ignorance and apathy for what has passed. Meursault’s final breakthrough is a complete sense of time—past, present, and future—giving him a fascinating depth and profundity wholly lacking at the beginning of the book. <br />		<br />In order to regain this sense of time, Meursault had to do two things: first, remove himself from the tyranny of custom; second, contemplate his own death. And these two are, you see, related: for custom discourages us from thinking about our mortality. Here we have another opened and closed circle. In the beginning of the book, Meusault goes through the rituals associated with the death of a family member. These rituals are pre-determined and conventional; death is covered with a patina of familiarity—it is made into a routine matter, to be dealt with like paying taxes or organizing a trip to the beach. Meusault has to do nothing except show up. The ceremony he witnesses is more or less the same ceremony given to everyone. (Also note that the ceremony is so scripted that he is later chastised for not properly playing the part.) <br /><br />At the end of the book, society attempts once again to cover up death—this time, in the form of the chaplain. The chaplain is doing just what the funeral ceremony did: conceal death, this time with a belief about God and repentance and the afterlife. You see, even on death row, society has its conventions for death; death is intentionally obscured with rituals and ceremonies and beliefs.<br />		<br />Meursault’s repentance comes by penetrating this illusion, by throwing off the veil of convention and staring directly at his own end. In this one act, he transcends the tyranny of custom and, for the first time in his life, becomes free. This is the closest I can come to an Aesopian moral: Without directly facing our own mortality, we have no impetus to break out of the hamster-wheel of conventional choices. Our lives are pre-arranged and organized, even before we are born; but when death is understood for what it is—a complete and irreversible end—then it spurs us to reject the idle-talk and comforting beliefs presented to us, and to live freely. <br /><br />This is what Camus would have all of us do: project our thoughts towards our own inescapable end, free of all illusions, so as to regain our ability to make real choices, rather than to chose from a pre-determined menu. Only this way will we cease to be strangers to ourselves.<br /><br />(At least, that is the Heideggerian fable I think he was going for.)",5
"Apathy is this man's primary way of dealing with the world. His mother dies and he goes to her funeral, yet he feels nothing, except tired and hot and drowsy. He is hungry and so he eats. He is aroused and has sex with a girl. He has a gun and the sun is hot and irritates him so he shoots a man 5 times and kills him. That is the first part of the book.<br /><br />In the second part of the book, comes the trial.The man is human in form, but does not feel emotions or empathy towards others. He is honest about this. His lawyer does not appreciate his truthfulness, as it hurts his case. At least, he has not learned to hide his inhumanity. He creates no false mask. You or society must take him as he is. Society decides to kill him. Isn't this as inhuman as what the man has done? Cold and calculating, the court finds him deficient and so he must die.",2

Some viewed the novel as a political roman à clef, laboriously substituting historical figures from Stalinist Moscow for Bulgakov’s characters. Others posited a religious formula to understand the relationships between good and evil in the novel.<br><br>After giving myself time to think, I believe that any attempts to reduce the novel to a formula reflect some readers’ desire for neat, safe boxes to contain the world. This approach is at odds with the fear-ridden, desperate, and yet transcendent reality of Bulgakov’s experience in writing, revising, destroying, reconstructing, and then revising the novel, up to his death in Moscow on March 10, 1940. <i>The Master and Margarita</i> shows evidence of Bulgakov’s struggles to complete it, especially in part two, which illness prevented him from revising. I believe that the novel’s profound humanity stems from these imperfections, these facets not quite fitting neatly together, these jarring movements from scene to scene. In the end, <i>The Master and Margarita</i> is, by virtue of its own existence, a testament to the necessity of art in times of repression, and to the urgent need for artists to veer from cowardice and hold firmly to their commitment to living a true human life, with fantasy and reality combined, with history and invention feeding into each other, with good and evil providing the shadows and depth that make life meaningful and real.<br><br><br><b><i>The Master and Margarita</i> as Fairy Tale</b><br><br>One approach to <i>The Master and Margarita</i> that appeals to me is understanding it, in part, as a fairy tale. In the novel, Bulgakov threads together three different storylines, which intertwine, especially at the novel’s conclusion: the often slapstick depiction of life in Stalinist Moscow, seen in part through the antics of the devil Woland and his demonic helpers; the story of Pilate, with names and details transformed from the familiar Biblical versions; and the story of the Master and Margarita. The action takes place in a compressed time frame, so readers looking for character development will be disappointed. Instead, Bulgakov develops an extended allegory where flight equals freedom, where greed and small-mindedness are punished, and where weary artists are afforded some mercy and peace.<br><br><i>The Master and Margarita</i> provided Bulgakov with a lifeline to the imagination in the midst of the stultifying culture of Stalinist Russia. There are healthy doses of wish fulfillment in the novel, especially in those sections in which Woland’s minions, Azazello, Behemoth, and Koroviev, wreak retribution for the petty-mindedness and greed inherent in this political and social system. There also is a desperate attempt to resist the Stalinist bent towards monotony and flatness, and instead to weave dizzying strands of magic, fantasy, and power into life in Moscow.<br><br><img src=""https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1380373889i/727673._SX540_.jpg"" class=""gr-hostedUserImg"" loading=""lazy""><br><b>Behemoth</b><br><br>These attempts to use a story as wish fulfillment, criticizing a social order by turning it upside down in fiction, and recognizing how to use an audience’s sense of wonder as a fulcrum for change, resonate with the historical and cultural functions of fairy tales as described by scholars including Jack Zipes in <i>The Great Fairy Tale Tradition</i> and Marina Warner in <i>From the Beast to the Blonde: On Fairy Tales and their Tellers</i>. Magic and wonder force the reader to acknowledge other possibilities outside of a reality of political repression, poverty, and war. When fairy tales reveal challenges to misplaced authority, whether in the guise of an evil queen or a greedy government official, they may take on one of two roles: a subversive threat to authority, or a valve to release the pressure of living under severe constraints. Perhaps most important, fairy tales remind their readers that life is miraculous, and that certain freedoms, such as the freedom to imagine and dream, can be nurtured and honored even under the most restrictive regimes. <br> <br>For Bulgakov, the blend of the fantastical and the everyday in <i>The Master and Margarita</i> serves as his manifesto. Throughout his life, he fought to preserve the full human experience, not the two-dimensional totalitarianism in the Stalinist USSR, where human life was flattened of any sense of wonder, creativity, exuberance. Instead, he advocated for human life with all its shadows and colors, with a foundation in imagination and wonder. The freedom he sought was not simply freedom from communal housing or repressive government policies. Instead, he sought the freedom to imagine, to dream, to infuse his life with wonder, and to share his vision. For this reason, any attempt to read <i>The Master and Margarita</i> as a simple satire of Stalinist totalitarianism is misguided. Instead, Bulgakov sought to fly free along with his characters, and in doing so to tap into the universal human need for imagination, wonder, and freedom of the intellect and spirit.<br><br><br><b>“For me the inability to write is as good as being buried alive”</b><br><br><img src=""https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1380373890i/727674.jpg"" class=""gr-hostedUserImg"" loading=""lazy""><br><b>Bulgakov and his wife Yelena, c. 1939</b><br><br>Although Bulgakov universalized his quest for artistic freedom in <i>The Master and Margarita</i>, he drew inspiration and a sense of urgency from his experiences.

(In response to one of these cases, Bulgakov destroyed one version of <i>The Master and Margarita</i>, which he later reconstructed.)<br><br>In desperation, between 1929 and 1930 Bulgakov wrote three letters to Soviet government officials, including Stalin, to protest his censorship and beg for a chance to practice his art, if not within Russia, outside it. In the final letter, dated March 28, 1930, Bulgakov movingly describes his ordeal, arguing that his duty as a writer is to defend artistic freedom, and pleading that being silenced is tantamount to death.<br><br>Although the letters provided Bulgakov with employment after receiving a favorable response, and saved him from arrest or execution, he still faced his works’ being banned and suppressed. He devoted the last years of his life to revising <i>The Master and Margarita</i>, knowing he would not live to see it published, and sometimes despairing it would ever be read outside of his family circle. His widow, Yelena Shilovskaya, worked tirelessly after his death for decades, preserving his manuscript and finally seeing it published, in a censored version, in 1966 and 1967. <br><br><br><b>Planes of Reality: The Fantastic, The Historical, and the Totalitarian</b><br><br><img src=""https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1380373890i/727675._SX540_.jpg"" class=""gr-hostedUserImg"" loading=""lazy""><br><b>Azazello, Behemoth, and Koroviev</b><br><br>Some criticism of <i>The Master and Margarita </i>comes from the abrupt transitions and changes in mood among the three storylines: the actions of Woland and his minions in Moscow; the transformed story of Pontius Pilate, with some striking changes to the names of characters and the sequence of events which simultaneously make the narrative seem more historical and keep readers off-balance; and the story of the Master and Margarita, which includes Bulgakov’s central concerns about cowardice, artistry, duty, loyalty and love. I believe that Bulgakov purposefully constructed his novel so that the reader would be pulled from dimension to dimension. The effect, although jarring, is one of constant instability and surprise. The reader is immersed in a world where a Biblical past seems more historically based and less fantastic than 20th-century Moscow, where characters who are petty and greedy are meted out fantastic public punishments, at times literally on a stage, and where in the end characters with the most substance and loyalty have their lives transformed through magic.<br><br>By carefully building this multifaceted world, with all the seams showing, Bulgakov forces us as readers to consider the intersections among these worlds. Bulgakov reveals how we cut ourselves off from the wellsprings of magic and wonder, and invites us to join him in mounting a broomstick and riding off into the night sky, free from the constraints of our everyday lives.<br><br><br><b>The Necessity of Shadows: Woland</b><br><br><img src=""https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1380373890i/727676.jpg"" class=""gr-hostedUserImg"" loading=""lazy""><br><b>Woland</b><br><br>Just as Bulgakov confounds his readers’ expectations of a unified and seamless world, so he also makes us question our assumptions about good and evil. A key character is Woland, the devil at the center of the magical action. From his appearance in the first chapter, Woland presents an arresting and disconcerting figure. Woland immediately inserts himself into a conversation with Berlioz, the editor of a literary magazine and chair of MASSOLIT, a prestigious literary association, and Ivan, a poet also known by his pen name Bezdomny, engaging in a debate with them about the existence of God. Berlioz parrots many of the current arguments against the existence of God, but Woland deftly counters his arguments in a manner that veers between the charming and the sinister.<br><br>This debate introduces a theme that runs throughout <i>The Master and Margarita</i>: a cosmos in which good and evil each have their jurisdiction, but work together to ensure that people get the rewards or punishments that they deserve. In a famous passage later in the novel, Woland provides the following cogent description: <br><br><i>“You pronounced your words as if you refuse to acknowledge the existence of either shadows or evil. But would you kindly ponder this question: What would your good do if evil didn't exist, and what would the earth look like if all the shadows disappeared? After all, shadows are cast by things and people. Here is the shadow of my sword. But shadows also come from trees and from living beings. Do you want to strip the earth of all trees and living things just because of your fantasy of enjoying naked light? You're stupid.""</i><br><br>Throughout <i>The Master and Margarita</i>, Woland metes out justice to wrongdoers. However, he does not simply punish -- instead, he also rewards Margarita for her devotion, intelligence, loyalty, and bravery. He rescues the Master from his exile in the asylum and ultimately grants him and Margarita a destiny of peace and rest together. In doing so, Woland overturns our expectations. Bulgakov describes a world where good and evil powers work together to provide some justice and balance in our lives, in spite of the thoughtless and cruel ways that humans behave. As Woland tells Margarita at one point, “Everything will be made right, that is what the world is built on.” The true evil in <i>The Master and Margarita</i> does not rise from Hell, but instead comes from the pettiness and greed of flawed, small-minded humans.<br><br><br><b>The Master and Margarita: Responsibility to Art</b><br><br>The Master makes his appearance relatively late in the novel, in chapter 13, “Enter the Hero.” However, he is not the traditional hero. He is a broken man, living in an asylum, remembering his love for Margarita, while at the same time turning his back on the art that Margarita loved, protected, and honored: his novel about Pontius Pilate.<br><br>In a lengthy conversation with Ivan, the Master paints an idyllic portrait of his life with Margarita, who creates a cozy sanctuary full of roses and love, in which the written word is treasured and respected: <br><br><i>“Running her slender fingers and pointed nails through her hair, she endlessly reread what he had written, and then she sewed the very cap he had shown Ivan. Sometimes she would squat down next to the lower shelves or stand up on a chair next to the upper ones and dust the hundreds of books. She predicted fame, urged him on, and started calling him Master. She waited eagerly for the promised final words about the fifth procurator of Judea, recited the parts she especially liked in a loud sing-song voice, and said that the novel was her life.”</i><br><br>However this idyll comes to a crashing end when the Master completes the manuscript and looks for a publisher. He provides harrowing descriptions of his brutal treatment by the literary world in Moscow, as editors, publishers, and fellow writers publicly criticized him for his novel. These descriptions bear the pain of Bulgakov’s personal experience with censorship and rejection, culminating in the Master’s paralyzing fear of everything around him.<br><br>Finally, in a scene inspired by events in Bulgakov’s life, the Master attempts to destroy his manuscript. Although Margarita salvages some pages, this scene marks the end of her life with the Master, who turns his back on Margarita and his art. He describes himself as a man without a name or a future, marking time in the asylum. Bulgakov depicts the Master as a broken man, whose loss of spirit and cowardice in the face of adversity led him to lose everything of value in his life.<br><br><img src=""https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1380373890i/727677.jpg"" class=""gr-hostedUserImg"" loading=""lazy""><br><b>Margarita</b><br><br>Margarita poses a stark contrast to the Master. When we finally meet her in part two, she is grieving over losing the Master, but she also shows herself to be intelligent, energetic, and fearless in her determination to find him and rebuild their life together. In doing so, Margarita is not taking an easy path. She is married to a successful husband who adores her. The two live in a large apartment with a great deal of privacy, a true luxury in Stalinist Moscow. She is beautiful, but she cannot put behind her deep dissatisfaction with her life, apparently perfect on the surface, but with no depth. She is living a lie. Her despair starts to break when she has a dream about the Master, which she views as a portent that her torment will soon come to an end. After rushing from her home, she has a fateful conversation with Azazello, whom Woland has tasked with inviting her to officiate as his queen at his ball. Margarita handles the interaction with spirit and courage, agreeing to follow Azazello’s mysterious instructions in hopes of learning the Master’s fate.<br><br><img src=""https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1380373890i/727678.jpg"" class=""gr-hostedUserImg"" loading=""lazy""><br><b>Margarita’s Night Ride</b><br><br>Margarita is transformed and embarks on a night ride, flying naked on a broomstick over Moscow. After wreaking havoc at the apartment of a publisher who had tormented the Master, and comforting a small boy who awakened, terrified by the destruction, she participates in a moonlight gathering of other magical creatures. Afterwards, she returns to Moscow in a magical car, “After all that evening's marvels and enchantments, she had already guessed who they were taking her to visit, but that didn't frighten her. The hope that there she would succeed in regaining her happiness made her fearless.” The night ride is a symbol of Margarita’s freedom and power.<br><br>Her fearlessness propels Margarita through her meeting with Woland and his minions, and a surreal evening as the queen of Woland’s midnight ball. Her devotion is rewarded by Woland, in scenes full of magic and moonlight. Although the Master crumbles in the face of adversity, Margarita becomes the ultimate hero and savior through her courage and commitment to the Master and his art.<br><br><br><b>The Moon</b><br><br>Throughout <i>The Master and Margarita</i>, Bulgakov uses key symbols to tie together the different chapters and storylines. Perhaps the most important symbol is the moon, which appears frequently in practically every chapter. The moon conveys a kind of otherworldly truth. Characters are bathed in moonlight at critical points in the novel, especially when making entrances, as when the Master first appears in Ivan’s hospital room. Moonlight imparts insight and truth even to the most delusional of characters. The moon lights the night rides of Woland, his companions, Margarita and the Master.<br><br><img src=""https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1380373890i/727680._SX540_.jpg"" class=""gr-hostedUserImg"" loading=""lazy""><br><b>Woland and company: Night Ride</b><br><br>The moonlight also features prominently in the Pilate chapters, serving as a lynchpin between them and the rest of the novel. Pilate looks up at the moon for solace in the face of his agony from his migraines and his cowardice, with his faithful dog Banga as his sole companion. Bulgakov uses the moon to illuminate Pilate’s torment and his final peace, granted to him by the Master, his creator:<br><br><i>""[Pilate] has been sitting here for about two thousand years, sleeping, but, when the moon is full, he is tormented, as you see, by insomnia. And it torments not only him, but his faithful guardian, the dog. If it is true that cowardice is the most grave vice, then the dog, at least, is not guilty of it. The only thing that brave creature ever feared was thunderstorms. But what can be done, the one who loves must share the fate of the one he loves.""</i><br><br>In response to Woland’s prompting, the Master stands and shouts the words that complete his novel, and end Pilate’s torture:<br><br><i>“The path of moonlight long awaited by the procurator led right up to the garden, and the dog with the pointed ears was the first to rush out on it. The man in the white cloak with the blood-red lining got up from his chair and shouted something in a hoarse, broken voice. It was impossible to make out whether he was laughing or crying, or what he was shouting, but he could be seen running down the path of moonlight, after his faithful guardian.”</i><br><br><img src=""https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1380373890i/727681.jpg"" class=""gr-hostedUserImg"" loading=""lazy""><br><b>Pilate, Banga and the moon</b><br><br>Bulgakov follows this transformative scene with Woland’s gift of peace to the Master. As she did throughout the novel, Margarita remains by the Master’s side, his loyal companion through eternity. Bulgakov cannot give salvation to the Master, perhaps because of the enormity of his cowardice against art, perhaps because he has been so damaged by a hostile society. In these final passages, Margarita gives the Master, and the reader, a soothing picture of a peaceful life, perhaps one Bulgakov himself longed for:<br><br><i>""Listen to the silence,"" Margarita was saying to the Master, the sand crunching under her bare feet. ""Listen and take pleasure in what you were not given in life—quiet. Look, there up ahead is your eternal home, which you've been given as a reward. I can see the Venetian window and the grape-vine curling up to the roof. There is your home, your eternal home. I know that in the evenings people you like will come to see you, people who interest you and who will not upset you. They will play for you, sing for you, and you will see how the room looks in candlelight. You will fall asleep with your grimy eternal cap on your head, you will fall asleep with a smile on your lips. Sleep will strengthen you, you will begin to reason wisely. And you will never be able to chase me away. I will guard your sleep.""</i><br><br><img src=""https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1380373890i/727682._SY540_.jpg"" class=""gr-hostedUserImg"" loading=""lazy""><br>",5
"I'm staying home from work today, sick to the extreme, and it's only in that unique feverish clarity that comes with illness that I dare to even try to write about this book.<br><br><b>This is THE book.</b> The one that all the other books are measured against. The one that I've read more times since I was twelve than the number of books some people I know have read in their entire lives. The one from which I've memorized entire passages. <b>This is it, the golden standard, the masterpiece, the unattainable perfection of literature. </b>I'm not even being sarcastic; I mean every single word of this praise. <blockquote>""<i>What would your good be doing if there were no evil, and what would the earth look like if shadows disappeared from it? After all, shadows are cast by objects and people. There is the shadow of my sword. But there are also shadows of trees and living creatures. Would you like to denude the earth of all the trees and all the living beings in order to satisfy your fantasy of rejoicing in the naked light? You are a fool.</i>""</blockquote>What is this book about? I wish it were easy to tell in one smartly constructed sentence, but luckily it's not. It is a story of Woland, the Satan, coming to Moscow with his retinue and wrecking absolute havoc over three long and oppressively hot summer days. It is a story of Pontius Pilate (<i>the equestrian, the son of the astrologist-king, the last fifth Procurator of Judea</i>) who has achieved the dreaded immortality due to a single action (or rather INaction) and wishes nothing more than for it to not have happened. It is a story of love between two very lonely people. It is a scaldingly witty story about the oppressive nature of early Stalin days and the rampant Soviet bureaucracy. It is a phantasmagorical story of the supernatural and the mythical. It has elements of humorous realism, romanticism, and mysticism. It is all of the above and much more. As doctors (the same profession that Bulgakov belonged to, by the way!), we are taught to look for the bigger picture, the synthesis of facts, the overall impression, the so-called 'gestalt'. <b>Well, the gestalt here is - it's a true masterpiece.</b><blockquote>

</blockquote>Bulgakov wrote this book over a period of 11-12 years, frequently abandoning it, coming back to it, destroying the manuscripts, rewriting it, abandoning it, and coming back to it again. He wrote it during the times when the reaction to such novels would have been the same as Woland has when hearing Master say he wrote a novel about Pontius Pilate:<blockquote>""<i>About what, about what? About whom?"" - said Woland, having stopped laughing. - ""In these times? It's amazing! And you couldn't find a different subject?</i>""</blockquote>In these times... The 1930s were the time of Stalin's rule, the waves of Purges, <b>the paranoia of one powerful man sweeping the country,</b> the denunciations, the lies, the terror, the fear, the accusations, the senseless arrests, the nondescript black cars pulling up to the apartment buildings in the middle of the night and leaving with people who would not be heard from ever again. This was a suffocating atmosphere, and the only way Bulgakov survived it was that he for reasons unknown enjoyed the whimsical favor of the tyrant. <b>This fear is everywhere, on every single page.</b> From the poor unfortunate Berlioz in the early chapters, who without much hesitation is about to contact the authorities to report about a suspicious 'foreigner' to the unnamed people conducting the investigation of the strange Moscow events and puling the victims in for questioning to Rimskiy sending Varenukha with a packet of information for the 'right people' to Master's terrifying and unheard story starting with <i>'them'</i> knocking on his window and ending with him broken in the mental institution... The fear is everywhere, thinly veiled. And yet it is never named, even once - the name of those causing the fear, never alluded to - no need for it, it's obvious anyway, and besides there's that age-long superstition about not naming the name of evil, which, funnily, in this novel is definitely NOT the Devil. <b>Only Margarita has the guts to ultimately ask, <i>""Do you want to arrest me?""</i></b><blockquote>

Behemoth exclaimed hotly. 'Dostoevsky is immortal!</i>""</blockquote>The sharp satire of the contemporary to Bulgakov Soviet life of the 1930s is wonderful, ranging from deadpan observations to witty remarks to absolute and utter slapstick (that, of course, involving the pair of Korovyev and Behemoth). It can be sidesplittingly funny one second, and in the next moment become painfully sad and very depressing. Not surprisingly - <b>in the Russian tradition humor and sadness have always walked hand in hand;</b> therefore, for instance, Russian clowns are the saddest clowns in the entire universe, trust me. This funny sadness manages to evoke the widest spectrum of emotional responses from me every single time I read this book, never ever failing at this.<blockquote>""<i>The only thing that he said was that he considers cowardice to be among the worst human vices.</i>""</blockquote>This book is not only the hilariously sad commentary on the realities of Bulgakov's contemporary society; <b>it is also a shrewd commentary on the never-changing nature of humanity itself.</b> The humanity that Woland wanted to observe in the Variety theatre, until he came to the sad but true conclusion that not much changed in them. The cowardice - the vice that Pilate feels Yeshua Ha-Nozri was implicitly accusing him of. The greed and love of money, leading to heinous crimes like treason and deceit and treachery. The egoism and vanity and self-absorption (<i>just think of the talentless poet Ryukhin's anger at the seemingly lucky circumstances of Pushkin's fame!</i>), the close-mindedness and complacency, the hate and bickering. This is all there, sadly exposed and gently (or sometimes not that gently) condemned. The consequences of this humanity shown in their extreme - think of Ryukhin's craving for immortality and Pilate's terror at facing it. <br><br><b>And yet we see one bright light of a redeeming quality in the mankind, the one that makes even Woland cringe - mercy. </b>Just think of people's reactions in the scene with George Bengalsky's head, Master freeing Pilate from centuries of doom, and - most touchingly of all - Margarita's unforgettable and selfless act of mercy towards Frieda. All that makes us not ashamed of being human. <b>All that makes us worthy not of the light, the naked light that Woland so derisively talked about, but of peace.</b> Just peace.<blockquote>

"<b>The Master and Margarita, Mikhail Bulgakov</b><br /><br />In this work, reality and fantasy, ""Real"" and ""Surreal"" are intertwined, it can be said that it is a kind of ""Russian magical realism"". The novel has philosophical and social themes, with a political background, which is subtly and indirectly reminiscent of the ""Stalin"" era, with a very delicate and artistic expression, and sometimes poetically, the problems of the society of the ""Soviet"" days. And at the philosophical level, reminds the reader of his book of the troubles and crises of contemporary man. ""Murshid and Margarita"" is a modern novel, which, according to Abbas Milani, ""is considered by many critics to be a classic novel.""<br /><br /><b>The Master and Margarita</b> is a novel, by Russian writer, <b>Mikhail Bulgakov</b>, written in the Soviet Union between 1928 and 1940 during Stalin's regime. <br /><br />The story concerns a visit by the devil to the officially atheistic Soviet Union. Many critics consider it to be one of the best novels of the 20th century, as well as the foremost of Soviet satires.<br /><br />The novel alternates between two settings. <br /><br />The first is 1930's Moscow, where Satan appears at the Patriarch Ponds in the guise of ""Professor"" Woland, a mysterious gentleman ""magician"" of uncertain origin. He arrives with a retinue that includes the grotesquely dressed valet Koroviev; the mischievous, gun-happy, fast-talking black cat Behemoth; the fanged hitman Azazello and the witch Hella. <br /><br />They wreak havoc targeting the literary elite and its trade union MASSOLIT. Its privileged HQ is Griboyedov's house. The association is made up of corrupt social climbers and their women (wives and mistresses alike), bureaucrats, profiteers, and, more generally, skeptics of the human spirit. <br /><br />The second setting is the Jerusalem of Pontius Pilate, described by Woland in his conversations with Berlioz and later reflected in the Master's novel. This part of the novel concerns Pontius Pilate's trial of Yeshua Ha-Notsri, his recognition of an affinity with, and spiritual need for, Yeshua, and his reluctant but resigned submission to Yeshua's execution.<br /><br />Part one of the novel opens with a direct confrontation between Berlioz, the atheistic head of the literary bureaucracy, and an urbane foreign gentleman (Woland), who defends belief and reveals his prophetic powers. Berlioz brushes off the prophecy of his death, but dies pages later in the novel. The fulfillment of the death prophecy is witnessed by Ivan Ponyrev, a young and enthusiastically modern poet. He writes poems under the alias Bezdomny (""homeless""). <br /><br />His futile attempt to chase and capture the ""gang"" and warn of their evil and mysterious nature lands Ponyrev in a lunatic asylum. There, he is introduced to the Master, an embittered author. The rejection of his historical novel about Pontius Pilate and Christ had led the Master to such despair that he burned his manuscript and turned his back on the world, including his devoted lover, Margarita. <br /><br />Major episodes in the first part of the novel include a satirical portrait of the Massolit and their Griboyedov house; Satan's magic show at the Variety Theatre, satirizing the vanity, greed and gullibility of the new rich; and Woland and his retinue taking over the late Berlioz's apartment for their own use. (Apartments were at a premium in Moscow and were controlled by the state's elite. Bulgakov referred to his own apartment as one of the settings in the Moscow section of the novel.)<br /><br />Part two of the novel introduces Margarita, the Master's mistress. She refuses to despair over her lover or his work. She is invited to the Devil's midnight ball, where Woland offers her the chance to become a witch with supernatural powers. This takes place the night of Good Friday. This is the time of the spring full moon, as it was traditionally when Christ's fate was affirmed by Pontius Pilate, sending him to be crucified in Jerusalem. The Master's novel also covers this event. All three events in the novel are linked by this.<br /><br />Margarita enters naked into the realm of night after she learns to fly and control her unleashed passions. (She takes violent retribution on the literary bureaucrats who had condemned her beloved to despair.) She takes her enthusiastic maid Natasha with her, to fly over the deep forests and rivers of the USSR. <br /><br />She bathes and returns to Moscow with Azazello, her escort, as the anointed hostess for Satan's great Spring Ball. Standing by his side, she welcomes the dark celebrities of human history as they arrive from Hell. She survives this ordeal and, for her pains, Satan offers to grant Margarita her deepest wish. She chooses to liberate a woman whom she met at the ball from the woman's eternal punishment. <br /><br />The woman had been raped and killed her resulting infant. Her punishment was to wake each morning and find the same handkerchief by which she had killed the child lying on her nightstand. Satan grants her first wish and offers her another, saying that Margarita's first wish was unrelated to her own desires. For her second wish, she chooses to liberate the Master and live in poverty-stricken love with him. <br /><br />Neither Woland nor Yeshua appreciates her chosen way of life, and Azazello is sent to retrieve them. The three drink Pontius Pilate's poisoned wine in the Master's basement. The Master and Margarita die, metaphorically, as Azazello watches their physical manifestations die. <br /><br />Azazello reawakens them, and they leave civilization with the Devil, while Moscow's cupolas and windows burn in the setting Easter sun. Because the Master and Margarita did not lose their faith in humanity, they are granted ""peace"" but are denied ""light"" — that is, they will spend eternity together in a shadowy yet pleasant region similar to Dante's depiction of Limbo.

"‘<i>All power is violence over people.</i>’<br /><br />Mikhail Bulgakov, who is no stranger to the pale fire of a burning manuscript, has created a masterpiece of fiction that truly cannot be burned. Having been completed, but not fully edited, by the time of Bulgakov’s demise, this novel survived Soviet censorship and the test of time to remain one of the foremost Russian novels of the 20th century, and still holds relevance in today’s world. From political intrigue and scathing social satire to religious commentary and witches on broomsticks, this is one of those rare books that can nestle its way into the deep places of almost any reader’s heart. Bulgakov lovingly loads each page with semi-auto-biographical frustrations and sharp irony as he unleashes the (literal) powers of hell upon Soviet Moscow.<br /><br /><i>Manuscripts don’t burn…</i><br /><br />Inspired by the epic <a href=""https://goodreads.com/book/show/14706.Faust__First_Part"" title=""Faust, First Part by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe"" rel=""noopener"">Faust</a> in its various forms, notably the opera which our author frequently attended, <u>Master and Margarita</u> spins the story of a Mephistopheles, Woland, and his cohorts as they wreck havoc upon the Moscow. This allows Bulgakov to deliver a potent slap in the face to all facets of the obdurate Soviet society that oppressed him and his contemporaries. Specifically targeted are those of the arts, particularly the authors of the times who used their words to tow the party line and the literary critics whom Bulgakov detested. The bitter satire of these writers, many of which are thrust into an existential epiphany that they are nothing but pathetic frauds when compared to Russia’s heroes of the pen such as <a href=""https://goodreads.com/author/show/16070.Alexander_Pushkin"" title=""Alexander Pushkin"" rel=""noopener"">Alexander Pushkin</a>. Mass mockery is made of the numerous beaurocrats and departments, the ease in which a citizen can be arrested, and endless other events that make the daily life of the 20's seem utterly absurd. It is no surprise countless characters find themselves in the asylum, the only place with order, comfort and logic in all of Bulgakov’s depiction of Moscow.<br /><br />Juxtaposed with Moscow is the tread of Pontius Pilate, which may or may not be the pages of the Master’s book. As the Master is not a far cry from Bulgakov himself, readers may notice a wonderful spiral into metafictional oblivion beginning here, and may begin to question the very notions and fabric of the novel they hold in their hands. Such as, who <i>really</i> is the intrusive narrator who whimsically guides us through this drama of demons, dreams and destiny, and where does the line between fiction and supposed-fact lie? However, I digress, and I return you to the tread of Pontius Pilate. Or, dear reader, shall I digress yet again, and direct your attention to the implicit irony inherent in the novel’s heroes: Woland (your charming Mephistopheles) and Pontius Pilate, the man who signed the death certificate of Jesus. Things are not always what they seem in this novel, and much of the dialogue and events are interestingly ironic. But yet, what is more flagrant to the upheld Soviet atheism than the devil himself preaching that Christ did in fact live? For how can they deny religion when the devil is right in their face? Bulgakov is a funny genius. And now, finally, I return to the Pilate thread, which itself is teeming with irony. For in the Pilate chapters, the reader will find a story that is seemingly biblical shorn of all religious implications and instead illuminating political plots and an attempt at a historically plausible event (the Master was a historian, or so he says) while the biblical allusions and quotations are found within the Moscow chapters instead. The ‘Satan’s Grand Ball’, of all places, has the most frequent biblical quotes and allusions. In a way, Pilate’s world is not unlike Bulgakov’s Moscow, full of dirty politics and persecution. On the other hand, the modern Moscow, which denies religion is full of religious symbolism (the 12 members seated at the MASSOLIT table, the severed head on a plate, etc). <br /><br />Each sentence of this book is a joy. The writing simply flows and is incredibly comical, plus the characters are very lovable. Woland’s demonic procession are highly entertaining and the reader will be compelled to keep reading just to see what chaos can be stirred by them as they flood the city. The Master, whom is a hero to all repressed authors, and his lovely Margarita are the gems within this story however. Although they lend their names to this novels title, these two lovers make up a very small portion to the story, and aren’t even relevant until part 2 when the book finds a groove and takes off like a cannon shot after wandering along the streets of Moscow for the first hundred and some odd pages. Always aware of his literary predecessors, Bulgakov leaves constant ‘scholarly jokes’ (as the translators put it) and allusions for a reader with an eye for Russian novels to discover. Anyone who is as enamored with the prose of <a href=""https://goodreads.com/author/show/232932.Nikolai_Gogol"" title=""Nikolai Gogol"" rel=""noopener"">Nikolai Gogol</a> as I am should definitely read this novel. Gogol is apparently a large hero of Bulgakov’s and he makes several allusions as well as stylistic choices fashioned off this master of absurdity. <br /><br />There are many different translations of this book, I myself chose the Diana Burgin and Katherine Tiernan O’Connor version published by Vintage (because really, you can’t go wrong with Vintage usually, not always but usually) because it offered a full version of the text and included many very helpful and insightful notes that really helped highlight the social context and the more apocryphal references. <a href=""http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/190202991"" rel=""nofollow noopener""> Nate has a wonderful review </a> that highlights the differences between the many translations and was very helpful in my choosing of this text. As I cannot read it as intended in it’s original language, I felt this was at least ‘<i>second-grade fresh</i>’.<br /><br />I cannot stress more how incredible this book is. It is just an all-around good time and a marvelous example of magical-realism used to its highest capacity. Despite it’s often dark and macabre nature, it is uplifting and laugh out loud funny. Plus, the ending is a kick to the head. I read much of this through the subways of Boston recently while on a much-needed and exceptional vacation, and, like Pilate and his crucified friend, the memory of both have become one. Bulgakov’s masterpiece has survived censorship and translation to make it to you, don’t pass it by!<br /><b>5/5</b><br /><br />‘<i>Gods, my gods! How sad the earth is at eventide!

And without regret he forsakes the mists of the earth, its swamps, its rivers, and sinks into the arms of death with a light heart, knowing that death alone…</i>’<br />Seriously.

This book is an interminable slog.<br /><br />Look, here’s the deal. I get that this book satirizes 1930s Stalinist Russia, and I get that—for some—this earns <i>The Master and Margarita</i> a place on their “works-of-historical-importance” shelves. But for me, it earns nothing. I mean, let’s just call a spade a spade, shall we? There are articles in the <i>Journal of Biological Chemistry</i> that have more successfully held my attention than this Bulgakovian bore. (<a href=""http://www.jbc.org/content/287/39/32861"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Exhibit A</a>)<br /><br />To start, the characterization in this book is near zero. Although there is a point where some barely discernable personality traits become apparent in one or two of the characters, by the time the reader makes it this far the show is nearly over. And if by curtain call the reader discovers Woland and his retinue to be even remotely interesting, it is not because of careful character construction. It’s more like the end of a really stuffy dinner party when you begin making your parting rounds. The thrill is in the palpability of finally being free of these people. Toodle-oo!<br /><br />And what is the author’s intent here, to single out the literary bureaucrats and the nouveaux riche? If so, the demographic is not effectively targeted. The Faustian demon who comes to wreak havoc across Moscow does so seemingly at random, with little adherence to agenda. Bartenders, ticket sellers, poets, little old ladies—they are all ambushed. It is clear someone needs to take a lesson from Omar Little, who “ain’t never put no gun on no citizen.”<br /><br />Whatever. I’m tired of even writing about this book. Before we part, though, I’ll leave you with several examples of yet another unworthy aspect of this novel: its ridiculous sentences. Here are some of my favorites.<br /><blockquote>
  <i>To tell the truth, it took Arkady Apollonovich not a second, not a minute, but a quarter of a minute to get to the phone.</i>
  <br />
</blockquote>I ask this question in complete earnestness: is this supposed to be funny? I have absolutely no idea.<br /><blockquote>
  <i>Quite naturally there was speculation that he had escaped abroad, but he never showed up there either.</i>
  <br />
</blockquote>Huh?<br /><blockquote>
  <i>The bartender drew his head into his shoulders, so that it would become obvious that he was a poor man.</i>
  <br />
</blockquote>Yeah, I give. I don’t even pretend to understand what this means. Anyhoo, hey—it’s been a pleasure meeting you all; we should do this again soon. Toodle-oo!",1

The authorities can only look on, powerless. Before the arrival of the devil, a “Master” wrote a novel about Pontius Pilate (this serene novel within the novel is entirely integrated in the story), which was dismissed by the regime, therefore sending the Master into a mental asylum. Margarita, the Master’s clandestine lover, makes a pact with the devil to save her companion writer.

As for his teeth, he had platinum crowns on the left side and gold on the right. He was wearing an expensive grey suit and imported shoes of a matching colour.

Clean-shaven. Dark-haired. Right eye black, left – for some reason – green. Dark eyebrows, but one higher than the other.

She had, of course, not forgotten him.<br />First of all let us reveal the secret which the master did not wish to reveal to Ivanushka. His beloved’s name was Margarita Nikolaevna.

"<b>Soviet Ghost Stories</b><br /><br />Stories, stories, all is stories: political stories, religious stories, scientific stories, even stories about stories. We live inside these stories. Like this one in <i>The Master and Margarita</i>. The story that we can more or less agree upon we call reality. But is it real?<br /><br />Story-making and telling is what we do as human beings. Through stories we create meaning out of thin air, in the same way that plants create their food from light, and usually with about the same level of casual unconsciousness. We then learn to share meaning and thereby create language and societies. We call this culture and have little idea what it means or how it works.<br /><br />What happens when stories, particularly stories about stories, are inhibited or forbidden? The most important result: society goes mad. And that part of society which becomes most mad is that of the professional story-tellers who, because they are the carriers of the essential human and cultural talent, become less than human. They are unable to tell the stories needed by the rest of us and enter a dream-like state of inexplicability and meaninglessness. <br /><br />The Master and Margarita is obviously a satire, a purposeful distortion of language to demonstrate its corrupt use. It is also obviously meant to recall the necessity for religious stories in a society that has degraded and mocked them. But for me the book is less about the corruption of Soviet society and its attitude toward the Christian religion and more about the even more fundamental beliefs that are the unspoken tenets of story-telling, that is to say, the philosophy of literature. <br /><br />In an important sense, literature is indistinguishable from religion. Religion cannot exist without it; but it is likely that literature could exist without religion. Literature precedes religion. Bulgakov notices this in his story of Christ before Pilate. <blockquote>“These good people,” the prisoner began, hastily added “Hegemon” and continued: “learnt nothing and muddled up all I said. In general, I’m beginning to worry that this muddle will continue for a very long time. And all because he records what I say incorrectly.”</blockquote> This is a direct attack on the ‘veracity’ of the gospel of Matthew. Bulgakov here implicitly contrasts religion against literature in his expanded and reinterpreted version of the biblical story of Jesus's condemnation and death; and he comes down decisively for literature as the more fundamental mode of thinking. The only thing beyond a text is... another text.<br /><br />This is not to say that literature should cause trouble for religion. The use of language is itself a religious experience even when it is used to parody religion as in Bulgakov's Communion of Sinners Ball and demonic Eucharist. Literature, consequently, exists as a spiritual (and social) rather than a material (and merely sensory) process. Materialism, of a Marxist, Capitalist, Scientific or any other sort, tells a story that cannot account for where its story comes from. Its causes cannot be enumerated and accounted for. Such a story is deficient and incomplete.<br /><br />Stories do not appear to be 'in nature' but they do comment upon nature. It is not inaccurate to say that they come from 'elsewhere.' And it is this elsewhere that is both the source and guarantor of the integrity of the stories that get told. Without the existence of this infinitely fecund elsewhere, the realm of the spirit, there is no way to verify the stories we tell ourselves. As Bulgakov has a psychiatrist point out to one writer, <i>""People can go around telling all sorts of stories! But you don’t have to believe everything!”</i><br /><br />It is this spiritual elsewhere that Bulgakov has intruding on and disrupting Russian civil society. In time-honoured fashion, the intruders are portrayed as devils who are able to exploit the presumptuous conceits of this society, especially those of the literary elite of the MASSOLIT, the state-run literary guild. It is the writers who sense this intrusion first and it is they who are quite properly driven mad - or to their death - by it. <br /><br />Bulgakov's demonic characters are up-front in their challenge to cultural reality. They make a reductio ad absurdum by denying the reality of language and the society and the culture associated with it. <i>""The seductive mystics lie, there are no Caribbean Seas on earth, and desperate filibusters do not sail them, and a corvette does not give chase, and cannon smoke does not spread above the waves. There is nothing, and never was there anything either!""</i> This challenge of course passes over the heads of the Soviet Citizenry.<br /><br />From the writers, the plague induced by constrained and distorted story-telling spreads to minor government officials. The local housing officer is the first casualty and he instinctively recognises the problem, <i>""Comrades!... We’ve got unclean spirits in our building!”</i> And he's right: the spiritual cannot be excluded, only deformed, by telling a story that denies the spirit. Such denial is patently a confirmation of what is being denied.<br /><br />It is through entertainment, 1930's stage vaudeville, that the condition is spread through the wider population. The presumably hidden or at least repressed culture of Soviet consumer society is shown for what it is - impressed as deeply as in any capitalist society by the linguistic distortions of brand names and wealth without purpose. The 'watching mass' has no idea that it is being shown itself, literally exposed, in all its mendacious cupidity.<br /><br />Even love, ultimately the cohesive force of marriage and family as well as society, is a product of language. It appears from that spiritual elsewhere, <i>""as a murderer leaps out from under the ground in a side street”</i> for the Master. Love may start with a look but it doesn’t progress beyond fantasy unless the look is the beginning of a shared story, interpreted by Margarita as an eternally fated event. The object that keeps them together while apart is of course the manuscript of the Master's book, an alternative gospel.<br /><br />If the medieval troubadours are not enough evidence of the cultural determination of the meaning of love, surely the varieties of love articulated in Shakespeare’s Sonnets, and accepted by generations since, clinch the case. Any society that attempts to limit what love, in all its variants, might mean is doomed by its own contradictions; and not just the Soviet variety. But it is Bulgakov’s conception of divine love that I find the most disturbing aspect of the piece.<br /><br />Any theologically aware person must at some point confront the problem of evil. Evil demands a story. The monotheistic religions subscribe to the story line that not only the Creator but his creation are ‘good.’ How then does the obvious evil in the world come about? <br /><br />The existence of evil is typically explained with one of several largely inadequate theories: Evil is a spontaneous development of a rebellious force against the goodness of God and His works; Evil is not an autonomous force but merely the localised absence of the divine within creation; Evil is actually inherent in a world that was formed by a subsidiary god.<br /><br />This last theory has a number of designations but is usually associated with the third century CE Persian Mani. So-called Manichaeism is the perennial thinking persons solution to the problem of evil since it accounts for the available facts of life without the need to invent a number of questionable metaphysical entities. It needs only one such beast - the flawed demiurge, a satanic figure who made a few mistakes in the way he shaped the cosmos and we have been dealing with the consequences ever since.<br /><br />It becomes apparent in The Master and Margarita that Bulgakov rejects all the classical theological explanations for evil, especially Manichaeism. But the resulting theology is not easy to digest. He suggests that what appears as evil, the work of Satan in the world, is in fact the disguised work of God. Bulgakov's contemporary, Carl Jung, termed this the Shadow and conceived it as an integral part of the divine. In The Master and Margarita, Bulgakov echoes Jung exactly in Satan's criticism of the evangelist Matthew: <blockquote>""Would you be so kind as to give a little thought to the question of what your good would be doing if evil did not exist, and how the earth would look if the shadows were to disappear from it? After all, shadows come from objects and people.""</blockquote><br /><br /><br />In other words: God is Satan; Satan is God. And God/Satan cannot be avoided or escaped. Even within evil, God is present. He is present among the atrocious evil-doers of his demonic ball; among the crass bureaucrats and proletarian graspers in the audience of the Black Magician; among the scammers and players of the system who try to get one-up on their fellow citizens; in Pilate and in Judas. And presumably God is present and active therefore within and through Soviet society despite official protestations to the contrary. (The idea of Soviet Moscow as Paradise Lost is perhaps the greatest irony/truth that Bulgakov expresses in the book)<br /><br />Of course Bulgakov does not make a theological argument. He tells a story. But in this story Satan as well as his devoted angels transform suddenly into their opposites, caring agents of human well-being; then into clownish Loki or Coyote trinitarian figures whose function is to play the fool with social institutions. There is no logic that can capture this divine turnaround from evil to love and play. But there is a narrative in which it can be described, and, on the basis of that description, be believed. <br /><br />Bulgakov’s technique, as well as the substance of his story, is not very different from, for example, the story of Exodus in which the God of Israel both allows the imprisonment of his people and then saves them from the situation he allowed to happen. The story also presents an alternative account of creation itself - as a text produced and protected by Adam and Eve, a couple which is bound together by it. Going beyond biblical bounds, religion itself is accounted for by the Master, the new Adam: <blockquote>""Of course, when people have been completely pillaged, like you and me, they seek salvation from a preternatural force!""</blockquote> And he is immediately corrected by Margarita, the new Eve with eminent practicality, <i>""Preternatural or not preternatural –isn’t it all the same? I’m hungry.”</i><br /><br />The theme, almost a running joke, is clear: The Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away. Blessed be the Name of the Lord. The situation is dire but not hopeless. Exile from the Garden means freedom as well as toil. This is a theme that demands great faith to assert. More than I have had at times certainly.",5
"A poet ""Homeless"" as he calls himself, and a magazine editor his gruff boss, Berlioz, are having a conversation in a quiet, nondescript Moscow park before the start of the Second World War. Drinking, just harmless sodas and discussing business, ordinary right? That's the last time in this novel it is. An apparition appears in the sky, weird and unbelievable, a frightening seven foot transparent man is seen floating above their heads, but only Berlioz spots it, he's obviously the editor, a very sick man... Later a foreign, debonair stranger joins them on the next bench, they will start an uncomfortable, lively, rather dangerous conversation about Jesus ( in the days of Stalinist Russia ), if he really existed. The newcomer, a self -described black magic expert tells the others, he saw Pontius Pilate and Jesus personally ! Naturally his startled companions look at him with a little disbelief, the two close friends think Professor Woland ( the name is discovered afterwards) must be a spy or crazy, either way authorities should be contacted immediately. Tragic results follow soon after, a wild, long, thrilling, death defying chase through many city streets ensues, strangest of all a giant black Tom cat , who walks on two legs and tries to get on a streetcar, but the heartless conductor says no cats, refuses entry. But Behemoth the big cat's name, does manage to get on the streetcar, they're very intelligent resourceful, demanding animals. What the devil is going on ? The charismatic professor and his talented entourage, give the best magic show on stage, ever seen in Moscow by an astounded audience, it's so spectacular, incomprehensible and not explainable that all the city wants to go also . Still ticket lines are numerous blocks in length, and growing too bad you missed it! Meanwhile a married woman Margarita, having an affair with an obscure, poor author writing a novel, she calls him ""Master"" you guessed right , the book is about the Roman Governor of Judaea Pontius Pilate. Mirroring Bulgakov's life the manuscript is banned... Countless, funny adventures follow involving soaring humans flying without a vehicle, the joys and terrors looking down you can imagine, and the destruction of fragile property everywhere... men disappear, creepy events happening all around the vast city and in the countryside.... The highlight is Satan's loathsome Ball, presided over by the stunned Margarita, as the incredibly reluctant Queen, attended mostly by the dead... eerie, bizarre and grotesque to say the least. A dream like, unworldly, vague, melancholic atmosphere permeates. Flamboyant, imaginative fable, a real classic.",5
"[Revised, pictures added 4/6/23]<br><br>More or less a novel, this book is also an allegory. Like Moby Dick, there are probably a dozen interpretations that can be given to it. The extensive local color comes from Moscow in the early Twentieth Century. The author wrote and revised it from 1929 to 1940, the year he died. This is a major book: more than 300,000 rating and more than 17,000 reviews on GR.<br><br><img src=""https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1680827401i/34117386.jpg"" width=""399"" height=""235"" alt=""description"" class=""gr-hostedUserImg"" loading=""lazy""><br><br>The main plot centers around a crowd of Russian literati: authors, theater goers and hangers-on, particularly one older world-weary author (the Master) and his beautiful young woman friend (Margarita). The devil and his sidekicks come to town and a lot of evil doings ensue. (If this were a modern Latin American novel, we would call it magical realism.) <br><br>Interspersed with the Moscow chapters is a mini historical novel that the Master is writing about Pontius Pilate and his agony over his decisions leading to the Crucifixion. Given that the Soviet Union in this era was promoting atheism, closing churches and persecuting religious folks, the main thesis seems to be summed up as follows: ""Surely the devil is real, and if so, there must be a God.""<br><br>Like Dante in his Divine Comedy, the author uses his work to settle old scores with critics and censors. <br><br>I wouldn't say that it's a book that I couldn't put down, but the plot moves along and it kept my attention.

"<b>
  <i> ""The devil went down to <s>Georgia</s> Moscow, he was looking for a soul to steal.""</i>
</b> <br />—Primus <br /><br />Phew! I needed a margarita after finishing <i>The Master and Margarita</i>! What a magnificent, turbulent read! <br />This extravagant Russian allegory is an adult 'Alice in Wonderland' bursting at the seams with mischief, darkness and rambunctiousness. The ghosts of Faust and Dante must have sat on the author's shoulders as he worked tirelessly on this masterpiece.<br />In short, this book was made for me! Come down from the heavens, Mikhail Bulgakov, and give me a hug, my brother from another мамочка. I'm so glad we found each other!<br /><br />The Devil and his motley crew breeze into 1930s Moscow and begin to wreak havoc by reading people's minds, decapitating citizens and throwing an astonishing stage show that scandalises the local glitterati. To give you some inkling of what we're dealing with here, one of Satan's sidekicks is a talking cat the size of a pig, who is always in the thick of things (Bulgakov was evidently writing magical realism before Gabriel García Márquez was even born). The humour is riotous and the badinage so hilarious that I was holding my ribs, kicking my legs and Cossack dancing around the room! <br /><br />In tandem with all of this magic and mayhem (please bear with me, dear reader) is a travel back in time to the trial and eventual crucifixion of Jesus of Nazareth. These subplot scenes are written in a completely different hist-fic style and are amazingly cinematic. The author's juxtaposition of the supernatural and the real is a constant stratagem throughout. <br />It would take me all day to discuss the symbolism that underpins this incredible book, so I won't bore you with every detail. Suffice to say that Bulgakov sets out to satirise the Stalinist regime he was oppressed by (was Orwell's <i>Animal Farm</i> inspired by this novel?) and the Devil is on hand to mete out an extreme brand of either punishment or reward to whoever displeases or pleases him (human cowardice is what really gets his goat). <br />The underlying parable jumps about all over the place – and sometimes out of windows on a broomstick! Heck, there is even a Magritte-style talking suit! I'd be lying if I said I'd grasped the significance of all of the author's philosophical analogies, but I certainly had a lot of fun trying. <br /><br />I loved this book; really loved it. And it's incredible to think that <i>The Master and Margarita</i> was fashioned in the 1920s. It was years ahead of its time and is like no other novel I've ever read. <br /><br />Clearly, this book wouldn't be for everyone, but if you like your literature dark, magical, intellectual, thought-provoking and absurd, then you should find room for it on your shelves. <br /><br />This was a buddy read with my wonderful magical realism friend, Kimber Silver. <br /><br /><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3353839958?book_show_action=false"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Kimber's review</a><br /> ",5
"In a Moscow public garden, a writer and a poet discuss religion: Did Jesus exist? While the writer tries to impose his vision of things on the poet, a third character suddenly appears as a movement of the air. He joins in the conversation of the two men, says to be a professor of black magic visiting Moscow for a series of consultations, and begins to tell a strange story about Pontius Pilate.<br />This stranger is, in fact, the Devil. It predicts the writer's death and his stay in the psychiatric hospital of the poet. However, when he leaves the public garden, Berlioz, the writer, dies precisely in the manner described by the Devil.<br />Begun in 1928 by Bulgakov, ""The Master and Margarita"" was not completed until 1940, shortly before the author's death. And it was not until 1966 that it was finally published in the USSR, cut by nearly 80 pages by censorship ...<br />Therefore, this magnificent novel had not immediately recognized for its actual value. And yet, what a masterpiece! A profusion of sets and characters, different plots from one chapter to another but invariably intertwined, makes this a magnificent fresco, colorful and still in motion, a bit like a crazy carousel, launched in endless and faster and faster turns.<br />There are three stories organized around the character of the Devil, who in Bulgakov's work is called Woland. First, we witness the drama in which the Devil's arrival and his troop plunge into Moscow. And what a drama! The Muscovite militia gives the impression of running in all directions to fight against the strange events which manifest themselves in the four corners of the city:<br />a) strange disappearances<br />b) theft of individual pieces of corpses<br />c) embezzlement<br />d) women walking around naked ( while Woland has just offered them dresses of great couturiers)<br />e) counterfeit money<br />The whole city is plunged into perplexity in front of the almost supernatural phenomena in Moscow, usually so peaceful.<br />Then we get to know the Master and his story, which forms the second story within the ""Master and Margarita."" Through the unfortunate Ivan, the poet gone mad and locked in a psychiatric establishment, we meet this famous Master. He is also a hospital resident and tells Ivan what made him angry. This Master is in love with Marguerite, a beautiful young woman who encouraged him to continue the novel he wrote when they met (because the Master is a writer) and deals with Pontius Pilate.<br />And this famous historical figure, the procurator of Judea at the time of Jesus' crucifixion, forms the third story of the novel. We are thus following in Pilate's footsteps from the moment he meets Jesus, thanks to Woland's account, which speaks of this historic moment to Berlioz and Ivan, and then to the Master's manuscript.<br />These three novels contain references and anecdotes about the USSR of Bulgakov's time. And the author is not kind to his country: more than once, he launches himself into hilarious scenes, which give the impression that he is trying to ridicule the established order. But, unfortunately, and fortunately for us, it is precisely this rather cruel humor of Bulgakov which, mixed with the many twists and turns of the story, make The Master and Margarita an absolute delight!",5
"This is a romp. While reading it I saw somewhere that Salman Rushdie said it was a major influence for him in the writing of <a href=""https://goodreads.com/book/show/12781.The_Satanic_Verses"" title=""The Satanic Verses by Salman Rushdie"" rel=""noopener"">The Satanic Verses</a>. I have an inkling, unconfirmed at this point, that <a href=""https://goodreads.com/author/show/13450.Gabriel_Garc__a_M_rquez"" title=""Gabriel Garcí­a Márquez"" rel=""noopener"">Gabriel García Márquez</a> and <a href=""https://goodreads.com/author/show/155517.Italo_Calvino"" title=""Italo Calvino"" rel=""noopener""> Italo Calvino</a> were also influenced by it. Several things about it surprise me. No doubt it's loaded with political subtext about Stalin's Russia; it was written during the years of the worst crimes of Stalin's regime. I speak here of ""dekulakization,"" in which some 20 to 50 million people died, many succumbing to cannibalism, and the Moscow show trials so carefully dissected by Robert Conquest in his <a href=""https://goodreads.com/book/show/52137.The_Great_Terror_A_Reassessment"" title=""The Great Terror A Reassessment by Robert Conquest"" rel=""noopener"">The Great Terror</a>. But I was oblivious to any such subtext while reading this novel. What struck me was the lively picture it gives one of Moscow in the 1930s. The tenor of the city, its street life, not to mention the look of the place and the landscape surrounding it. The parks and public spaces. I had seen Moscow before in Tolstoy and Dostoevsky, but that was late 19th century Moscow, a provincial city parroting Parisian culture and language. I also remember--how can I forget?--the sinister Moscow of Solzhenitsyn's <a href=""https://goodreads.com/book/show/335673.The_Gulag_Archipelago__1918_1956_An_Experiment_in_Literary_Investigation__books_I_II"" title=""The Gulag Archipelago, 1918-1956 An Experiment in Literary Investigation, books I-II by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn"" rel=""noopener"">The Gulag Archipelago</a>. But here we have a Moscow bursting with life, with people enjoying their lives. Yet, it's also a Moscow that aspires to world dominance. It was that contradiction that was always foremost in my mind as I read. One wonders how Bulgakov did it? Turning out this fabulist masterpiece in the midst of such craziness, such instability. But all that aside the book is finally unlike anything I have ever read before. Description is really the book's strength: action and imagery. There's no plot to speak of. (You can look elsewhere in these reviews for a description of the storyline.) It's character driven. And it never flags. An absolutely astonishing book.<br /><br /><a href=""https://pin.it/4191jsM"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Sign near Patriarch Ponds, Moscow</a>.",5
"This is going to be a short one. I am too disappointed to be able to write much. I am not disappointed with the book but with myself for failing to love this one. I have no idea what went wrong. I love satire and the subject seemed to be something I would be interested to explore. I liked it, I got some of the hidden meaning but overall I was not enthralled. <br /><br />I tried both the audiobook narrated by one of my favourites, Julian Rhind-Tutt and the written Romanian version. None of the two versions left a lasting imprint in my soul. I could admire the craftmanship and the importance of the novel but I could not get immersed in the story. The plot felt too convoluted , there were too many characters, too much chaos, I got tired. <br /><br />I plan to re-read it at some point in the future because I believe the novel deserves a 2nd chance. <br />",3
"This book by Bulgakov is a miracle - a magical text of incredible imagination that miraculously did not get its author shipped out to a gulag and forgotten. Miraculous that the book made it out of Stalinist Russia for our enjoyment. Miraculous as it is a work of sublime beauty and a fitting 20th C Faustian story. A must-read to understand a slice of reality under a totalitarian government. The writing is engaging and highly imaginative. I need to reread this one again!<br /><br />Just rereading tonight and loving the Pontius Pilate / Yeshua episode. As far as reinterpreting and reimagining a biblical story, it is funnier than KOK’s <a href=""https://goodreads.com/book/show/6705926.A_Time_for_Everything"" title=""A Time for Everything by Karl Ove Knausgård"" rel=""noopener"">A Time for Everything</a> and almost as profound as Dosto’s Grand Inquisitor in <a href=""https://goodreads.com/book/show/4934.The_Brothers_Karamazov"" title=""The Brothers Karamazov by Fyodor Dostoyevsky"" rel=""noopener"">The Brothers Karamazov</a>.

"The Master and Margarita by Soviet era writer Mikhail Bulgakov seems to inspire strong emotions though most critics and commentators have been impressed with the fantastic satire. Le Monde listed the novel number 94 on its 100 books of the century. I found it absurd, outrageous, inconsistent, but for the most part entertaining. <br><br>I would probably appreciate the novel more if I better understood Bulgakov’s scathing satire on atheistic Soviet society, which he exposes as materialistic and bourgeois. The book is alternately set in 1930s Moscow and Jerusalem during the execution of Yeshua Ha-Notsri, a translation as Jesus. Pontius Pilate is an integral part of both settings as an acting character in his own time and as the subject of an unburnable manuscript by “The Master” in Moscow. <br><br>The premise is that Satan and his demonic retinue has come for a visit to Moscow and this visit is used by Bulgakov as a means to critically observe the Soviet Russians. One of the most endearing scenes was the Satanic Ball hosted by Margarita and attended by the celebrated damned from Hell. <br><br>Bulgakov's theme of the relationship between good and evil is a strong message that works well from the spirited, forced perspective allegory. It has been suggested that the Rolling Stones song “Sympathy for the Devil” was influenced by the novel and it also seems clear that Bulgakov was himself influenced by Faust. <br><br>All in all, this is an important work, though it may not be timeless as many of the references to Soviet life were not clear to this 21st century suburban American. This is one I may try to read again in a year or so as I may need to think about it more.<br><br><img src=""https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1567771365i/28108526._SX540_.jpg"" width=""400"" height=""174"" alt=""description"" class=""gr-hostedUserImg"" loading=""lazy"">",4
"4 stars for a very Russian story but a universally appealing book which demonstrates that the power of imagination has no boundaries, and much can be achieved through literature as the author unleashes a stinging satire on Russian life at the time of Stalin, but with humour perfectly woven into a very profound story.<br /><br />There have been many reviews of this book and a wide range of opinions as once again we are presented with a very unique novel that draws us into the world of magical realism that forces us to think and interpret what the author was actually conveying as he wrote this ingenious book. The reader must suspend disbelief, read between the lines, and embrace the many themes but most of all this book will require your undivided attention. A complex novel sometimes confusing but oh so clever.<br /><br />Unique, incredibly accomplished, and strongly evocative - both macabre and hilarious, dark yet enlightening, and magical but with very real themes.<br /><br /><b>The Plot </b><br /><br />The Master and Margarita has two main time periods; Jerusalem at the time of Pontius Pilate during the trial and subsequent death of Christ and in Moscow in the 1930s, where Satan first appears at Patriarche’s ponds as Professor Woland. <br /><br />Whilst the two men (part of the Moscow elite) discuss Ivan’s writings and the possibility that Jesus did not exist, Woland appears accompanied by Behemoth, a large black cat that walks on his back legs; Hella, a female vampire; and Azazello, a hitman. Even more mysterious, the strange visitor informs the men that he was there the time of Jesus’ trial and goes on to make a prophecy that Berlioz will be decapitated before the day is out. Meanwhile Bezdomny’s hysteria when relaying the days events, and demise of his learned colleague, see him incarcerated in a mental institution for the mentally insane, despite being a poet and writer which only adds to the suspicion surrounding him.<br /><br />Part two introduces Margarita, the Master's mistress, who refuses to give up hope for her lover. It is this love story that features heavily in the second half with the adoring Margarita committing to the devils wishes to have her beloved ‘Master’ freed and so willingly succumbs to his power.<br /><br />All the layers and multiple threads start of converge in this second half and what can sometimes feel like random and bizarre events turn out to be quite poignant and incredibly symbolic.<br /><br /><b>Review and Comments </b><br /><br />This has been described as a masterpiece, a literary giant, but for me this book stands out for its uniqueness in revealing the injustices in a Stalinist Russian and let’s the reader witness the destruction of an open and free society, not through political rantings but through magical realism that exposes censorship, absurdness, and cowardice through humour.<br /><br />So why the 4 stars? I didn’t really connect with the story of Pilate and the last days of Christ. Whilst I understand what the author was trying to achieve this didn’t work for me personally. Plus, I enjoyed the second half of the book more when we got to Magrarita who the book takes its title from. <br /><br />Whilst not a criticism, I paused reading and did some research to reacquaint myself with Stalin’s Russia to understand the social, political, and religious critique at that time, and it was only then that I would say I fully appreciated the brilliance of this novel and for all it represented.<br /><br />Despite not enjoying all aspects of the book, this is still a very worthy 4 stars; a true work of art and a feast for the senses and the mind. The story is highly imaginative not just with the story but how the story was told. The vivid descriptions of the times, place, people, and emotions was superb, the use of magical realism, humour, and irony to expose the blind acceptance of people in a Stalinist Russia was also very clever, poignant, and relevant - even today. <br /><br />From the ridiculous to the sublime and the magical to the farcical the author goes to the extreme in painting a surreal picture of a political system that prohibits people from speaking out, and in doing so we experience the mix of good and evil, courage and cowardice, and intellectual curiosity curtailed within a rigid system - and herein lies the beauty of this book. A book that is the definition of magical realism. A book that pushed all the boundaries at the time, and above all a wonderfully unique book that holds the bar high for originality.<br /><br />Food for the mind, brilliant imagery, superb storytelling, and great satisfaction for this reader - And to one of my favourite quotes.<br /><br /><i>“What would your good be doing if there were no evil, and what would the earth look like if shadows disappeared from it? “</i>",4

So when I say it’s no easy matter to add anything that’s not been said better elsewhere, most of you will know what I mean. That’s especially true with this group, loaded with smart people who’ve already done their reviews. The group (which we all thank Kris and Mary for running so well) has been great for providing discussions and links to help interpret the symbols, themes and historical context. But this, too, makes original thoughts about it hard to come by. Anyway, this is my justification for punting, and instead trying (perhaps too hard) just to be different.<br /><br />I will say that I never really lost myself in the story nor cared about the thinly drawn characters. Maybe it’s not meant to be that kind of book. The greater pleasure was in trying to figure out the different elements of the allegory, what the broader questions were, and how Stalinist oppression may have driven it. The fact that this emerged in the 60’s as a samizdat well after Bulgakov’s death in 1940 was part of the appeal. The axe he was grinding to counter the shush on creative freedom continues to resonate. <br /><br />It’s easy to pose questions: What does the devil (Woland) represent? What is Bulgakov saying about Stalinist Russia; the general population; the arts community/intelligentsia? Is there a religious angle? What about moral judgment; free will vs. determinism; the nature of man?<br /><br />I won’t attempt to answer these because 1) I don’t want to supply any spoilers, and 2) I’m not sure I can.<br /><br />Others have done a much better job addressing the main themes: good vs. evil, courage vs. cowardice, and related to that, artistic freedom vs. toeing the line. About the only motif I haven’t seen mentioned is the contrast between felines and canines. The big, black, humanized cat in Woland’s retinue was like a badly behaved Marx brother. As an example of his character, he tried cheating at chess. Conversely, Pilate’s dog was nearly fearless and ever faithful. I’m surprised that cat owners have not been more vocal in their protests against such an unfavorable contradistinction.<br /><br />Three stars is a cop-out, I know. I was caught between extremes. The story and characters failed to draw me in, but it was an interesting exercise in interpretation.<br />",3
"This is a bit like trying to explain the ""Harry Potter &amp; the Forbidden Journey"" ride at Universal Studios (a constant ad on Goodreads [also, cool factoid: this is actor Daniel Radcliffe's favorite novel!])--I will eventually make a fool of myself trying to describe the orchestrations of both the physical body with the pyrotechnics &amp; rollercoaster mechanics... see, I just can't.<br /><br />And one can't quite get to the bottom of ""The Master and Margarita""--a trippy, satirical, hard-to-classify classic of the mid-century Russian variety. It remains an almost mystical experience. Strange, exciting literary terrain is traversed and it truly titillates the senses. It is a panorama with no beginning and no end--which begins at the beginning of Christian times and ends... or does it? It stays in the mind--there is soo much to ponder here. The details are mostly red herrings--but are they? Uffh!<br /><br />Deja vu is not uncommon. It's like being inside nesting dolls that are degutted, with jewels for entrails! Surreal doesn't befit it, nor does ""parable."" Quite not.<br /><br />An opera of wondrous dimensions! You'll enjoy it...",4
"What. The Hell. Was That? <br /><br />This Russian novel was so wacky and schizophrenic that it gave me a headache.<br /><br />I had never heard of ""The Master and Margarita"" until a book club friend said it was one of her favorites. It comes weighted with a lot of praise -- it is considered one of the great Russian novels and has been listed as one of the best books of the 20th Century.<br /><br />I read a lot of glowing, 5-star reviews of this book, but I just didn't connect with it as others have. I didn't even like the book until page 217, which was when Margarita finally showed up. The second half of the book is definitely better than the first half, which really plodded along in places.<br /><br />But I'm getting ahead of myself, so let's back up. According to the introduction, Bulgakov was upset about how Christ was portrayed in Soviet anti-religious propaganda, so he wrote a satire about what would happen if Satan suddenly appeared in Moscow. The novel pokes fun at the greed and pettiness of people, and at the rigid social order in Russian life. <br /><br />While I did have a few giggles at the hijinks that ensue when the devil starts making mischief -- and there's a talking cat! -- there were also these frustrating flashbacks to Pontius Pilate in Jerusalem, which is what gave me a headache. And I'm getting another one just thinking about trying to summarize the rest of the story, so forgive me if I pop some aspirin and recommend anyone who is interested in this novel to read <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/304643397?book_show_action=false&amp;page=1"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Kris' excellent review</a>. She got way more out of this book than I did.<br /><br />Bulgakov worked on the novel for more than a decade, but in several different versions because at one point he even burned the manuscript. (One of its most famous quotes is that ""manuscripts don't burn."") <br /><br />While I know enough about Stalin's oppressive regime to appreciate the creative protest that Bulgakov was undertaking, I think I would rather read a biography about the author than to ever reread ""Master and Margarita.""",2
"This book is my all-time favourite. I have recently listened to The Master and Margarita by Mikhail Bulgakov on Audible narrated by Julian Rhind-Tutt New English translation by Michael Karpelson, the most exciting listening. Also, I have read it in its original language, Russian, respectfully, which was quite a challenge despite me having had Russian language lessons in high school. I have read it in Lithuanian to understand better it. This classic is phenomenal, a gift from Russian society geniuses. Every time I read or listened to this book, it was hilarious, exciting and intense—how the author shows politics and delicately touches inside problems in Russia. The plots with the devil and Jeshua are priceless.",5
"<i>The Master and Margarita</i> is undoubtedly the most unusual book I have read. The book is written in two parts: The first part opens with the Devil's arrival in Moscow and the series of tragic events that take place in its wake. Devil, who goes by the name Woland, and his retinue create havoc in Moscow targeting literary elites, the most important target being Berlioz, the head of the Moscow Literary Union known as MASSOLIT, a renowned atheist. Most of the literary members being atheist receive cruel punishment at the hand of the Devil and his assistants. <br /><br />I had a difficult time finding a plot in this section. What I read was a series of tragic events that took place, which saw several literate elites being fallen victim to the Devil. However, the interesting thing about Bulgakov's writing is that, although you do not properly grasp what it is all about, nevertheless you can enjoy what he writes. It is full of religious and social satire. I have only a limited knowledge of the Stalin regime in the Soviet Union, but I can clearly see Bulgakov's satirical attack on his governance. There is also a subtle attack on the growing atheism in the Soviet Union and perhaps on the contribution to that by the literary elite. And after reading a bit of the biography on Bulgakov, I felt this part of the book is his personal vendetta against the literary giants who made working as an author difficult for him.<br /><br />The second part deals with the Master and Margarita. If there is a story in this book, I found it only in this part. The master, having written a novel on Pontius Pilate and the crucifixion of Jesus Christ, and on its being rejected for publication and severely criticized, falls into despair (to this extent the master resembles Bulgakov) and finds him in a lunatic asylum under the Devil's clutch. Margarita, the faithful, young, and beautiful lover of the master, works on a pact with the Devil with a view of rescuing her beloved. The chapters that dealt with their story were quite interesting. I read that Bulgakov's third wife, Elena, was the inspiration for the character Margarita. Her devotion to Bulgakov and his works is indeed reflected in Margarita's devotion to the Master and his work. <br /><br />Bulgakov's approach to the story is in a fantasy form, but he nevertheless, has done a great job in bringing out the satire he clearly intended when writing it. The story is dark, dangerous, and at times violent, but also entertaining and humorous. Never in my life had I thought I would say a dark and dangerous book entertaining. But in all honesty, it was entertaining; the due credit goes to Bugakov for his excellent writing. And although I'm still convinced I didn't understand the story fully, it was still an enjoyable read.",4

  <b>""What would your good do if evil didn't exist, and what would the earth look like if all the shadows disappeared?""</b>
</i> <br />― Mikhail Bulgakov<br /><br />The intriguing cover gave nothing away, while the title made me long for a frosty drink on the beach. I hadn’t heard a whisper about this book before, unaware of the captivating discovery I was about to make. Like a multifaceted gem, each sparkling page of this fantastical Russian wonder drew me deeper into <i>The Master and Margarita's</i> brilliant world. I was soon running along the steamy streets of Moscow with a vibrant cast of characters, doing my best to keep up with their unbridled antics as they turned the city on its ear.<br /><br />The story packs a magical realism punch with a capital ‘M,’ delicately infused with a tale of imperishable love. A recurring theme reminiscent of a Faustian bargain is served with a large side of comedy and a big black cat as a dining companion. Most of all, it was a joy to be immersed within the pages of this multilayered novel.<br /><br /><i>""Love leaped out in front of us like a murderer in an alley leaping out of nowhere, and struck us both at once. As lightning strikes, as a Finnish knife strikes! She, by the way, insisted afterwards that it wasn’t so, that we had, of course, loved each other for a long, long time, without knowing each other, never having seen each other…""</i><br /><br />While I openly admit this won't be the book for everyone, <i>The Master and Margarita</i> will be one of my favorite reads of the year. <br /><br />If beautifully written prose and a scrumptious yarn that knows no boundaries are what you are looking for, then you’ve come to the right place!<br /><br />Thank you, Kevin Ansbro, for this fantastic buddy read!<br /><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3330076338?book_show_action=false&amp;from_review_page=1"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Kevin's review</a>",5
"<b>Abercrombie has been titled as Lord Grimdark for years now; I truly believe that <i>Last Argument of Kings</i> is majorly responsible for this.</b><br><br><b>
  <i>
    <blockquote>“Round and round in circles we go, clutching at successes we never grasp, endlessly tripping over the same old failures. Truly, life is the misery we endure between disappointments.” </blockquote>
  </i>
</b><br><br><i>Last Argument of Kings</i> is the third—and final book—in <i>The First Law</i> trilogy by Joe Abercrombie. Every plot lines from the first two books lead to the revelations and ruthless conclusion in this installment. The story picks up immediately from where <i>Before They Are Hanged</i> left off, and it has come full circle. Depending on your perspective, the <i>Last Argument of Kings</i> is either bittersweet, depressingly bleak, or in between; I personally think it’s the latter. Abercrombie writes as if he’s a maestro of death and hopelessness. If you’re hanging on the edge of a cliff, Abercrombie will give you a dangling rope to save you but when you use that rope to save yourself from falling, he annihilates your hopes by using that rope to strangle you when you’re at the top. Yet, I must say that it is precisely for this unforgiving realism that I end up considering <i>Last Argument of Kings</i> as my favorite book in the series. <br><br><b>Picture: <i>Last Argument of Kings</i> by <u><a href=""https://www.artstation.com/abalakin%20"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Alexander Preuss</a></u></b><br><br><img src=""https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1565770747i/27991191._SY540_.jpg"" width=""400"" class=""gr-hostedUserImg"" loading=""lazy""><br><br>By this point of the series, I think it’s safe to assume that you—like me—have grown very attached to the utterly memorable characters. Although some of the side character’s story continues in the next standalone trilogy of the series, this is where the main story arcs for the six main POV characters ended. Abercrombie has expertly weaved a tale that exhibited a harsh truth; despite insanely hard works and virtuous intentions, things may not go in our favor just because of one cruel reason: life isn’t fair. If you’re reading this review, and you haven’t started <i>The Blade Itself</i>, I’ll suggest you to not expect that a happy conclusion will be reached; you’re not getting one. In my opinion, none of the main characters attained what readers usually consider as a satisfying/happy ending; what they do get, however, is an ending that fits the narrative of the series. Expect an unflinchingly vicious finale, and it’s highly probable that this trilogy will go down as one of your favorite series; it’s certainly one of my favorites. What Abercrombie does well, he does extremely well.<br><br><b>
  <i>
    <blockquote>“I have learned all kinds of things from my many mistakes. The one thing I never learn is to stop making them.” </blockquote>
  </i>
</b><br><br>Speaking of the things that Abercrombie does well, the action scenes in this book were top-class. Out of all the grimdark fantasy series I’ve read, when it comes to close-quarter combat, Abercrombie’s <i>First Law</i> and Jeff Salyards’s <i>Bloodsounder’s Arc</i> are always the first to come to mind. Abercrombie has conjured tempestuous war and battle scenes within this finale. We’ve seen glimpses of the deadly magic of the series in the previous two books, but in <i>Last Argument of Kings</i>, Abercrombie displayed the cataclysmic potential of the magic and why they became forbidden to use. The action sequences were bloody, violent, and downright merciless. This is by far the most action-packed and explosive installment in the trilogy; even if I were to include all the books published in the series so far within my assessment—this includes <i>The Heroes</i>—I’d still put <i>Last Argument of Kings</i> above them all, both in quality and quantity.<br><br><b>
  <i>
    <blockquote>“Travel brings wisdom only to the wise. It renders the ignorant more ignorant than ever.”</blockquote>
  </i>
</b><br><br>The war scenes were incredible, but if I were to choose one main highlight of the book, it would have to be the duel scene. If you’ve read this book, you’ll know which confrontation I’m talking about. Back when I first read this duel three years ago, I immediately thought that it was phenomenal; on my reread, I still feel the same way about it. It’s terrifying to me how vivid it was; it honestly felt like I was there. I could hear the sound of swords singing, and I was able to see blood and gore poured from the heart-hammering trade of skills and deathblows unleashed that made the decisive duel unforgettable. Abercrombie has seriously outdone himself in this particular scene. Abercrombie painted a devastating scene that’s incredibly easy to visualize within this circle of death where chaos and the Great Leveller reigns. I’ve read many fantasy novel that features amazing duel scenes, and I can easily vouch that the mighty clash of death here, together with the one in <i>The Sword of Kaigen</i> by M.L. Wang, are indeed the best duel scenes I’ve ever read in a novel; it was THAT good!<br><br><b>
  <i>
    <blockquote>“You can never have too many knives, his father had told him. Unless they're pointed at you, and by people who don't like you much. ” </blockquote>
  </i>
</b><br><br>It suffices to say that <i>Last Argument of Kings</i> is grimdark fantasy at its best, and it is one of my favorite books of all time, simple as that. I loved this book on my first read, and I’m gratified to say that I still absolutely love it on my reread; maybe even more now. Abercrombie is a fantastic writer and storyteller; his characterizations are masterful, his prose is compelling, and his capability in creating vivid cinematic scenes that are brutal, intense, philosophical, and at times hilarious established him as one of the finest authors in the genre. For years now, <i>The First Law</i> have often be recommended as a must-read series for <i>A Song of Ice and Fire</i> fans and grimdark fantasy enthusiasts. The longevity and the assurance of high quality in this recommendation can exist only if a specific series has received a world-wide qualification and praises from readers around the world. And this is a crowning achievement that Joe Abercrombie, the Lord of Grimdark, has indisputably claimed from this trilogy. If you—somehow—haven’t read this series yet, consider fixing that mistake by reading <i>The First Law</i> trilogy. Now. You have to be realistic about these things.<br><br><b>

"Because, even after the first two volumes, every character will STILL surprise you. Because Glokta is the best fantasy character I've found since Tyrion Lannister. Because Logen is a mushroom-cloud-laying motherfucker. Because you should've seen it coming but you didn't. You really didn't. <br /><br />Because even ""gritty"" fantasy writers are usually afraid to go this far against expectations. Because you will laugh. You will get angry. Because you will hate the ending. Because the ending is perfect. Because the last surprise is on the last page. <br /><br />Because every combat sequence is spot on. Because every character's actions are spot on. (Despite the fact that we sometimes don't need quite as much explanation as we get.) Because we need more fantasy authors willing to give people like Terry Brooks, Margaret Weiss, Tracy Hickman and Robert Jordan a really good wedgie. (Giving dead people wedgies might be in bad taste, but it's occasionally necessary.)<br /><br />Because worlds with swords and sorcerers are boring when they're perfect. Because people are boring when they're perfect. Because perfect things are boring. Because this series is totally not boring. Because in some ways Abercrombie's series works better than A Song of Ice and Fire (in some ways, just some, not all of them, please put down those rocks).<br /><br />Because it's time to read something entirely made out of awesome. Because this is it. Because. Just because. ",4
"<b>A spectacular ending to an incredible series -- One of the best books fantasy books of all time.</b><br /><br />The last book in a fantasy series can make or break the entire thing, and luckily <i>Last Argument of Kings</i> achieved this in spectacular fashion. This book is legitimately one of the best fantasy books ever written, and will help this series be considered an all-time great fantasy series, among the titans of this genre like <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> and <i>A Wheel of Time</i>.<br /><br />The tone of this book is dark, and involves a lot of bad people doing bad things to each other. The twists are legitimately mind blowing, in part due to how overwhelmingly impactful they are, and in part due to the seeds of these twists being planted in the previous books without the reader knowing. And while the entire book in amazing, the ending of this book is 10/10 perfection.<br /><br />From a riveting selection of a new king, to the greatest 1-v-1 duel ever written about in a book, to an ancient feud between wizards that comes to a head, to the most bittersweet of endings -- this book is incredible from start to finish. <br /><br />Joe Abercrombie has rightly been titled as one of the titans of this genre, and anyone with even a vague interest in fantasy with darker elements needs to read this book yesterday.<br /><br /><b>

"and so the excellent First Law trilogy concludes. this was a splendid experience and certainly a hearty one as well. many things to consider and many enjoyments to be had. a full meal! and quite a bitter feast at that.<br /><br />and here is the Last Argument of the title, succinctly delivered by the ferocious sorceror Bayaz:<blockquote>
  <i>""Power makes all things right. That is my first law, and my last. That is the only law that I acknowledge.""</i>
</blockquote>SPOILERS FOLLOW<br /><br />this is a really marvelous series. bold in intent, clear in purpose, both a strikingly rigorous critique of the systems of power and a fun, fast-paced adventure that turns expectations around narrative &amp; characterization upside down. it is not perfect; the most egregious fault is a certain shallowness in the dialogue - many lines read as if they are coming from a particularly snarky tv sitcom. i do not like. but that fault, and other minor ones, pales in comparison to all the positives of the trilogy.<br /><br />the first book basically functions as a a prologue. indeed, in other books, the entirety of the action in that book would probably have been dispensed with in a chapter or two. but <a href=""https://goodreads.com/book/show/944073.The_Blade_Itself__The_First_Law___1_"" title=""The Blade Itself (The First Law, #1) by Joe Abercrombie"" rel=""noopener"">The Blade Itself</a> sees the building of character and the constructing of a strong foundation for its overarching narrative as key to its design, and so The Blade Itself sticks in the memory as one of the most in-depth introductions to the action that i've experienced. a bold move; i like. the second book is where all the action is at. but man does Abercrombie fuck with reader expectations in <a href=""https://goodreads.com/book/show/902715.Before_They_Are_Hanged__The_First_Law___2_"" title=""Before They Are Hanged (The First Law, #2) by Joe Abercrombie"" rel=""noopener"">Before They Are Hanged</a>. there are two primary narrative threads in the second book: a Quest for a Band of Adventurers and the Defense of a City Under Siege. for such a contrastingly (to the first book) action-packed novel, the decisions of how to end these two adventures is rooted in the need to illustrate <i>failure</i> - so much so that the novel functions as a sardonic critique and attack on the use of Quests and City Sieges in fantasy. the Quest goes nowhere; nothing is gained and the whole thing is pointless. the Defense of a City fails; good people are slain, a city is taken, and then the 'hero' is rewarded for doing a good job in drawing out the Siege - his actual failure being preordained by his loathsome masters. truly a a kind of rough justice in terms of reader expectations for classic narrative pleasures; i like.<br /><br />Last Argument is likewise determined to smack the reader upside the head with their own complacent desires. this happens in two distinct ways: (1) showing the true darkness at the heart of its sometimes rather loveable characters and (2) giving the novel's various narrative threads some of the bitterest versions of happy endings that i've experienced.<br /><br />to the first goal, it is important to point out what Abercrombie did in the second book: he made his characters highly appealing. their courage &amp; loyalty &amp; cleverness are highlighted and they are given amusing character traits to make them charmingly down-to-earth. they grow and they do brave things and the novel shows that they can be better human beings, if given the opportunity. the third book is counting on the reader to remember those positive little bits - all the better to sting that reader when they are reminded of these characters' true natures. the only person who escapes unscathed is the most unloveable character of all - the savage and bloodthirsty Ferro, who is my own favorite character. <br /><br />other characters do not make it out with their loveability intact. Logan the berserker barbarian's stomach-turning past is actually explored (with an emphasis on his various mindless atrocities) and, most importantly, we are given a scene where we witness Logan's terrifying alter ego do truly horrible things. my God, he cuts a child in half! he becomes distinctly un-loveable after that little bit. and the same goes for the rest: anti-heroes who Abercrombie set up to be surprisingly sympathetic are given their chance... not to shine, but to molder. Glokta tortures innocent people that he knows are innocent, simply because he is following orders. Jezal overindulges his tendency towards frustrating ditheriness. Ardee becomes a self-pitying, self-loathing lush. Black Dow, Frost, and Severard betray those who have given them trust. Quai is shown to be a foul imposter. and most stark at all, Bayaz the Eccentric Magician is shown to have the true colors of a classic megalomaniac, uncaring of who he hurts &amp; kills, primarily interested in maintaining his authority, a liar and a bully and a murderer, contemptuous of all who do not share his goals, and willing to do literally anything to further those goals and gain more power. Bayaz the Eccentric Magician - the only character who seeks to truly protect a kingdom against the powers of darkness - turns out to be the darkest monster of them all. i like.<br /><br />to the second goal... well, i don't want to do what i did above, and list the viciously ironic happy endings delivered on all the remaining characters. one example will suffice: a Happy Marriage for a king and his new bride. a happy ending where a lesbian is forced to pretend to be deliriously happy to bed her man night after night - or else her lover, a stalwart lady-in-waiting, will be tortured and killed. a happy ending where the naive new king is so pleased with his wife's change of heart that he never questions how that radical change of heart occurred. he finds her crying at the window each night after a session of lovemaking... well, it must be because she is homesick!<br /><br />the cumulative effect of all of Abercrombie's bleakly sardonic decisions is one that gave me a hollow, depressed feeling. and yet i was thoroughly engaged and challenged by each of his decisions. i felt attacked; i felt like the rug was pulled out from under me; i felt as if all that i held to be important and meaningful were simply false constructs based on lazy thinking and a complacency with what i have automatically considered as ""good"", as ""right"". being challenged like that is a rare thing. i like.",4
"this book blurs the lines between good and evil sooo well that i dont even know what to think. <br /><br />i read somewhere that suggested a bad villain is someone who is just a jerk for no reason, a good villain is someone who thinks theyre right but in reality theyre wrong, and a great villain is someone who IS actually right but their methods go beyond what any moral person would approve of. <br /><br />and let me tell you what - there are so many great villains in this. but they dont even feel like villains! thats the crazy thing. its that whole morally grey anti-hero vibes that almost every character has. its fantastic.<br /><br />and its the characters that really sell this book/series, because honestly, the plot in this concluding installment didnt really do it for me. if you enjoy political and war manoeuvring, then you will enjoy this. but i personally found all the strategy and battles to be boring. im also not really sure i even liked the ending. for me, everything should come together in a conclusion and, in this, everything feels like its falling apart? i dont know how to describe it, but it wasnt what i was hoping for. <br /><br />overall, great characters, good plot if youre into that kind of thing, and unexpected ending. <br /><br /><b>↠ <i>3.5 stars</i></b>",4
"Disappointing. This book probably deserves better than two stars, but I just can't bring myself to call it good, because I didn't really enjoy it even though I read it fairly quickly. Don't get me wrong: it's interesting enough, and the characters are still vaguely engaging, and there's plenty of action. By all means, the formula is there (even though it does feel a little bit tired).<br /><br />So what's the problem? I guess I was just hoping Abercrombie would be able to salvage some of his characters and bring the story to a satisfying conclusion, but frustratingly, most of the characters end up less likeable at the end than they were at the beginning, and the book's ""conclusion"" feels loose and sloppy.<br /><br />I'm okay with a ""no good and no evil"" sort of world, with ambiguous heroes, but for crying out loud, Abercrombie can't seem to come up with a sympathetic character, or any sort of heroic progression. His characters are in turn spineless, self-centered, vengeful, ruthless, feckless, and amazingly passive. Unlikeable in the extreme. Logen seems to be a completely different character from one book to the next, Ferro is static, Glokta becomes boring (can he stop tonguing his gums for a page or two, please?), and Jezal crumples into a worthless sack of dookie. By the end of the book, there was not a single character I was rooting for, and I really didn't care whether they lived or died. In fact, I was kind of hoping they would die, since then there wouldn’t be any sequels. Whatever happened to characters like Elric of Melnibone, Raven of the Black Company, Caine, Tyrion Lannister, Riddick, et al?<br /><br />The humor seems to have disappeared by the third book, as well. This is too bad, since humor actually makes the characters a lot more sympathetic.<br /><br />There is also some odd plotting. The logic of Bayaz is baffling: why exactly is he spending so much effort to build an empire when he could have accomplished his goals with a lot less hassle (he is, after all, incredibly rich and powerful and all that). And why does he show so little interest in ""his"" empire? Not even a hint of pride? What’s the point?<br /><br />In the end, that’s what I came to. What exactly was the point of the story?<br /><br />Oh well. Maybe I’ll pick up another book by Abercrombie someday, but not any time soon.<br /><br /><br />",2
"Wow. Just finished, and that was a book that was just... wow. Made expectations, fulfilled them, broke them apart into little pieces and reassembled into a huge jagged collage of a work. Amazing. <br /><br />Glokta continues to be the character you would love to hate, except that he is the very essence of tortured humanity. Jezal grows beyond a self-involved ego into a man willing to stand for his beliefs--except that he remains manipulated and somewhat ignorant of the extent to which he is played. Logen unfortunately sees too many more appearances of The Bloody Nine, and it costs him almost everything even as he wins. Commander West continues to lead with loyalty and strategy. Everyone is so humanly flawed, admirable in their nobility and despicable in their actions at times. <br /><br />Truly an impressive but uncomfortable work. The dark side of fantasy, not because it delves into Evil with the capital ""E,"" but because it shows how choices and character continue to drive us, perhaps causing us to make the very same mistakes, or the choices we make when we have no choice at all.

"ORIGINALLY POSTED AT <a href=""http://www.fantasyliterature.com"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Fantasy Literature</a>.<br /><br />Say one thing for this reviewer, say she's a weak-minded sucker.<br /><br />She really enjoyed the first two books of Joe Abercrombie's The First Law trilogy. This story was original, had a unique style, fascinating characters, and a darkly cynical style. She liked it. It was fresh. But she was kind of hoping, even daring to expect, that the last book, Last Argument of Kings, might have an ending that was, if not perhaps exactly happy, at least somewhat satisfying.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Last Argument of Kings was more realistic than happy. Hooray, some might say -- a realistic ending! But realistic is not what this reader reads fantasy for. For three books she read about people's heads being chopped off, painful body parts clicking, toothless gums being sucked at, pain, wasting disease, bodies being cleaved in half, more pain, betrayal, torture, treason, tyranny, loveless marriages, abusive fathers and brothers, miscarriage, alcoholism, prejudice, more pain. Lots of pain. It has to get better, right?<br /><br />Alas, no. There just wasn't enough redemption to balance all of the pain. A couple of characters became more noble (they couldn't have become less so), but their triumphs were outweighed by the degradation of other characters. It was all just kind of depressing.<br /><br />Besides that, there really wasn't anything new in Last Argument of Kings. The story ends (for better or for worse), but there was none of the freshness that was so exciting in The Blade Itself. The writing is well above average, but not brilliant, and it certainly wasn't pretty.<br /><br />What she's trying to say is: The First Law is an entertaining and well-written story for someone who is more the cynic than the optimist.

Bethod, King of the Northmen is a constant threat and there’s only one man who prevent him from conquering the Union, yeah you guessed it, our guy Logen Ninefingers. As Logen is facing the minor task of defeating a whole army, Superior Glokta is up to his usual tricks of torture and blackmail in the capital. There is more of a personal mission for Glokta this time around as it quickly dawns on him that there’s only so many power-hungry lords he can continue to keep smiling. Jezal dan Luthar is back in the capital seeking to let go of the life he once loved, of fame, women, gambling, to focus on beginning a family with the woman he loves, but can it really be that simple? Again I’m sure you’ve guessed the answer to that one. In true Abercrombie style, nothing is ever simple - you have to be realistic about these things. Also, book 3 brings about the true discovery of who Bayaz is, our questions are answered and he really comes into his own. I’ll leave it as that!<br /><br /><b>“It's hard to be done a favour by a man you hate. It's hard to hate him so much afterwards. Losing an enemy can be worse than losing a friend, if you've had him for long enough.”</b><br /><br />One thing I love about Joe’s writing is just how clear each distinct voice is. You really know who the POV is from just after reading one sentence and I find that rare, especially one with multiple POVs. The characters are so quotable, with fantastic lines of speech and thoughts, it’s top quality writing. Each character has ample moments to shine which is exactly what you want in a final entry of a series, I felt so satisfied after finishing Last Argument of Kings - not to mention THAT ending. It was one of those few wide-eyed panic infusing moments that had me desperate for just one more chapter.<br /><br /><b>“The only difference between war and murder is the number of dead.”</b><br /><br />Within Last Argument of Kings is one of the best duels ever. Abercrombie writes action so well, so brutally full of gore. I felt the cuts, the burn of muscles, the panic of battle and the euphoria of victory. The Bloody Nine has some of his best scenes to date here and they gave me the chills, as did Logen’s father’s sayings about war. What I also love about The First Law is the balance of characters. Not every character needs to be or is a legendary sword-wielding beast of a man who smashes his way to victory. Sure it’s good fun to read but there’s none of that here. The character’s find their own way to take on battles, literally and metaphorically.<br /><br /><b>“Rules are for children. This is war, and in war the only crime is to lose.”</b><br /><br />I also love how much depth there is to all of the characters even secondary ones such as The Dogman, Black Dow, Ardee and Arch Lector Sult. There were sections of non-stop action without much pause for breath, and there were other passages of the calm, allowing us to really get into the characters and understand them even more. There were touching scenes in the Last Argument of Kings that added so much to the story and the way I felt about the characters - which I find very rare in a grimdark story.<br /><br /><b>“You can never have too many knives, his father had told him. Unless they're pointed at you, and by people who don't like you much. ” <br /><br />5/5 - I’m sure you can tell how much I loved this and The First Law. I would recommend this trilogy to anyone who likes reading. Or just everyone. If fantasy is your thing then this is a must read, and if fantasy isn’t your think then this is a brilliant starting place to highlight just how amazing it can be when written well. Mr Abercombie, I salute you. I hope to see the likes of The First Law again.</b>",5
"The end of this series is a cleverly crude mirroring of it’s opening, and it’s just so damn hilarious. I’m saying no more regarding that, but Abercrombie never fails to make me laugh. Logan Nine-fingers is such a great character; he really is the strongest aspect of this series. <br><br><b>
  <i>“You can never have too many knives, his father had told him. Unless they're pointed at you, and by people who don't like you much. ” </i>
</b><br><br> <img src=""https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1520605673i/25187353._SX540_.jpg"" width=""400"" height=""350"" alt=""description"" class=""gr-hostedUserImg"" loading=""lazy""><br><br>His wise courage allowed him to defeat the impossible. Only he would have survived such an ordeal. Abercrombie sure knows how to write an excellent battle sequence, but the one on one combat at the end of the book is a whole new level of gripping. It was tense. It was exciting. And it felt like it could have gone either way. Every stroke of the sword was vital. One wrong move and it was over. The odds were against Logan; he faced a terrible foe, but Logan is a survivor. He has been through so much in his life, and he will continue to face his enemies until he falls. He is unshakable. <br><br>His proficiency for killing grants him a new beginning by the end. He is in a position where he could go anywhere and be anyone. It will be interesting to see how far the character goes in the future. Now I’ve of course read <i>Red Country</i> but I want to see Logan after that. I hope one day that we finally get to see his end, whatever that may be. I think we need to because at the moment Logan’s story is far from over. An origin story would also be quite good. We know the basics of where he came from, but to read about it all would be great. <br><br><b> Strong endings all round </b><br><br><b>
  <i>“Power makes all things right. That is my first law, and my last. That is the only law that I acknowledge.”</i>
</b> <br><br>Logan is not the only great character in this series. Sand dan Glokta stands amongst my favourite characters in all fantasy fiction. He is on par with Tyrion Lannister in his wit, cynicism and intelligence. He is the unsung hero. He is the cripple; the man twisted with rage and despair, but he also pulls through it and continues to serve his country despite his many personal daemons. He finally gets his due, one deserved and one justified. Perhaps. <br><br>As I said with Logan, I would love to see a reprisal of this character. His newest novels (The Shattered Sea trilogy) whist in themselves quite good, simply are not on par with his first trilogy. The tone isn’t the same. The story is not as good. So I think a return to this world is in order, hopefully some time soon.<br><br><u> The First Law Trilogy</u><br>1. <i> The Blade Itself</i>- <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/826620666?book_show_action=false"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">A bloody four stars</a><br>2. <i> Before They are Hanged </i>- <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/860654051?book_show_action=false&amp;from_review_page=1"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">A gritty four stars</a><br>3.<i> The Last Argument of Kings</i>- <b>A strong four stars</b><br><br> <img src=""https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1520605901i/25187368._SX540_.jpg"" width=""400"" height=""200"" alt=""description"" class=""gr-hostedUserImg"" loading=""lazy"">",4
"Okay, so here's the thing with this book and why I gave it no stars:<br /><br />1) It's the third and final volume in a trilogy that up to this book was pretty much as good as fantasy gets: good characterizations, egaging plot, nice overall writing style, etc etc etc.<br /><br />1a) I specifically liked the first two because they were surprisingly nasty, not dark mind you (no brooding emo heroes of the night), <i>nasty</i>.<br /><br />1b) ""Nasty"" isn't meant sexually either, incidentally, in case you were flashing to Janet Jackson right then.<br /><br />2) All of that remains true for this book. I think it's important to know that no actions or events in this book are implausible given what's happened before or are unbelievable to the characters as written to this point.<br /><br />SPOILER-ISH<br />3) Man, everything goes to shit and everyone dies or is fucking miserable forever is what happens here in book three. <br /><br />4) And that turns out to be the point of it all, the philosophy the series intends to convey: That everyone is a total shit and you will die and death will be awful and degrading, but that's what life's like anyway so who cares. <br /><br />4a) I think it's because that's the IT of the series that I found the book so dispiriting and also retroactively ruinous of the first two, which I no longer particularly like knowing what they'd lead to. <br /><br />4b) Which makes me worry a little that I've turned into Pollyanna No-Unhappy-Endings let's have some cookies and hugs.<br /><br />4b -i) Or even worse, someone who requires moral edification in entertainment.<br /><br />5) I am going to resist those ideas about myself, even as I struggle to figure out why this is so repugnant to me, why I feel so.. almost offended by this book. I guess because this ending seems as trite as one where everyone wins and has cookies and hugs, only looking for some deeper credibility by instead of cookies it's slavery instead of hugs it's sharp pointy sticks being jabbed in various orifices. It ends up not TRYING to say anything more then the easiest black or white thing it could say, and it's even worse when you have this feeling the author COULD HAVE DONE BETTER. ",0
"Good gracious and gravy, this initial trilogy was amazing!!!

  <b>Here is a review of Last Argument of Kings on the channel - <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TgLgGndvmg"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">The Brothers Gwynne</a></b>
</i><br /><br /><b>“Rules are for children. This is war, and in war the only crime is to lose.”</b><br /><br />Dived into this third instalment in The First Law trilogy straight after finishing Before They Are Hanged. I was tempted to leave it a few days, as I actually felt trepidation at finding out what happens to the characters that I now love, despite their serious flaws. I know that Joe Abercrombie can be a nasty, nasty man to his characters, but I hoped there could be a Disney happy ending here. <br /><br />Is that silly?<br /><br />Yes. Yes it was. <br /><br />This is so real that I could just turn on the news. But it is also incredibly enjoyable, don't get me wrong about that. Joe Abercrombie has cultivated a reputation for being a cruel writer who will spare no pain from his characters. I'll be honest, that is well earned. I felt so emotionally manipulated it was unbelievable. It shows it’s a fantastic story if you feel that much emotion and attachment to the cast. But it still doesn’t make it the most pleasant of experiences.<br /><br /><b>“You have to realistic about these things.”</b><br /><br />Joe Abercrombie is famous perhaps mostly for his characters, and that is because they are so unique and now iconic. Glokta the tortured torturer, he does such terrible things, but you’re still routing for him. Logan Ninefingers, who you just feel so, so sorry for, but who is also terrifying, as is made crystal clear in this finale. Jezal, the once most infuriating character, now the man who I somehow want to emerge victorious. They are the main three perspectives, but then there are the brilliant other perspectives and major characters. West, who is possibly the closest you will get to a good man in an Abercrombie book. Then Bayaz, who you should never cross, and many more. Joe Abercrombie is an absolutely masterful character creator, and he brings about a satisfying conclusion for every character.<br /><br />Whilst Abercrombie is most well known for his characters, I think this sometimes means that people neglect to mention the perfectly executed plot, which was obviously all set out from the beginning of the series. All the little breadcrumbs you didn’t even know were there reveal themselves in this conclusion. The twists were magnificently announced, making you understand everything, and wonder how you missed it. Again, I’m going to use that word. Masterful.<br /><br />Then their is the prose and action. Abercrombie subtly changes his prose for each perspective, which adds to the brilliance and realisation of the characters I mentioned earlier. But he is also brilliant at creating any tone that he needs. The tension between characters, the humour between friends, the despair when all is lost, the panic of a battle. All are achieved brilliantly. Also, I have to say that the duel in this book is the second greatest that I have ever had the pleasure of reading. And that is high praise.<br /><br /><b>“You can never have too many knives”</b><br /><br />This is one of the best books I have ever read, and one of the best endings to a series as well. It was amazing. I feel sad, depressed, lonely and lacking faith in humanity, but it was still awesome to read, and it is definitely a story that lived up the hype and delivered a if not happy or enjoyable conclusion, a very well crafted and satisfying one, and one that is awesome to talk about long after you have closed the final page. <br /><br />Everyone should at least try picking up The First Law Trilogy. It could easily become one of your favourite series of all time.<br /><br /><b>5/5 STARS</b><br /><br /><i>

    <b>“Rules are for children. This is war, and in war the only crime is to lose.”</b>
  </i>
</blockquote><br /><br />I am 10 years late to the party but I am happy that I finished my first trilogy by Abercrombie and it met most of my expectations! I mentioned in my reviews of the last books that the books read like one huge story rather than three books and it means this book had to tie up everything and close all the story lines which it did in one way or another.<br /><br />Abercrombie’s does not need any introduction from me, he is well known as the lord of dark fantasy for a good reason. The prose is very unique and gripping as it was in the last books!<br /><br />The characters are still what makes this book and Abercrombie this successful! The characters are very memorable, specially Glokta who is literally everyone’s favorite and to be honest, the story took some directions and thus character development that I did not see! All the characters arcs are closed in this one and except for the very last pages, I liked how weird and dark it was! I was very confused by the epilogue and salty to the fate of on the characters but I did some research and got some answers to their mysterious fate!<br /><br /><blockquote>
  <i>
    <b>“If you want to be a new man you have to stay in new places, and do new things, with people who never knew you before. If you go back to the same old ways, what else can you be but the same old person?”</b>
  </i>
</blockquote><br /><br />Also this was pretty merciless with all the action and war going, it meant saying good bye to many of the characters which may also make it a kind of an emotional read.<br /><br />The plot is probably the best in this book because we finally get all the reveals and twists and we have the final anticipated war! The world gets more expanded and the magic more interesting and we get a few surprises along the way!<br /><br /><blockquote>
  <i>
    <b>“I have learned all kinds of things from my many mistakes. The one thing I never learn is to stop making them.”</b>
  </i>
</blockquote><br /><br /><b>Summary:</b> As good as can be expected from lord grimdark himself! This is a very good conclusion to the trilogy and I am definitely excited to read more Abercrombie next year!",4
"3.5/5. Still love Abercrombie's writing style, characters and humour but the nihilistic nature of this series really got me down during the finale",4
"As the Gurkish march on Adua, Bayaz schemes to defeat them, Jezel discovers his secret parentage, and Glokta tries to learn things no one wants him to know. Meanwhile, the Northmen are holed up in a fortress in the hills with Bethod's army at their gate, waiting for the Union army to arrive. Will they arrive in time? Is even Bayaz enough to defeat the Gurkish?<br /><br />Apart from my Dark Tower reread of 2011, It's been a long time since I read the final book in a fantasy series. I guess re-reading the Elric books was the last time and probably Amber before that. The Last Argument of Kings, final book in the First Law trilogy, is way up in the series ender hierarchy.<br /><br />The manure hits the windmill in a serious fashion in this volume. Several pretty important characters die. The rest of them have their lives change in real ways. Who would have Jezel dan Luthar and Logen Ninefingers would wind up kings? Or what would happen after they did? <br /><br />Glokta and Bayaz were by far the most captivating characters in this volume. Glokta shocked me time and time again and I'm still not sure if Bayaz slew his mentor or not, only that he has his fingers in most of the pies in the bakery. All the revelations toward the end blew my mind.<br /><br />There are so many things I want to gush about in this volume, like Bayaz using the Seed against the Eaters, Glokta marrying Ardee West, and the fight between The Bloody Nine and the Feared. I knew the confrontation was coming as soon as the Feared was introduced and I was pretty sure of his weakness. I just didn't picture the battle to be so brutal.<br /><br />The character development over the course of the three books was pretty damn amazing considering where Jezel, Logen, and the rest started. The ending was the icing on the cake.<br /><br />Like I said in my reviews of the other books, people compare these books to George R.R. Martin but they aren't that similar other than the brutal deaths. The First Law is way more like Pratchett. This particular volume reminds me of Watchmen quite bit when the heroes find out just how thoroughly they've been jerked around.<br /><br />Five blood drenched stars. That's all I have to say.<br />",5
"<i>""Delightfully twisted, and evil.""</i> The excerpt from The Guardian tells everything you need to know about <b>Joe Abercrombie</b>. He writes twisted fantasy where the characters are as wicked and dark as the plot twists and morale is not a relevant consideration for any decision. And he writes it well. In short time he has become one of the leading names of the genre, mainly thanks to the First Law trilogy that concludes in the <i>Last Argument of the Kings</i>.<br /><br />And after finally completing the trilogy, I can't help but coming to the conclusion that Abercrombie has nothing to offer to me.<br /><br />I freely admit that he writes very varied characters, who have believable flaws and internal struggles. His dialogue is great and each character has a distinct voice of his or her own. However, by the third book in the trilogy, the obsession of making everyone dark, troubled, twisted, and gritty starts to work against the story. The transition from one character to another no longer offers an interesting contrast, and the plot twists start to become very predictable. This is not shades of grey, this is just the black of a black-and-white world. And as a result, none of the characters really develop anywhere during the story, even though they all had enough inner demons to really do so.<br /><br />I was also very disappointed to see that my biggest worry after reading the first two books was very much realized: Abercrombie is all about his characters, and in the end he does not have a very interesting story to tell. Or that he does not tell it in a very interesting way. When I finally got to the bit where a handful of pages were dedicated to revealing what was actually going on behind the scenes, I very much wanted to groan.<br /><br />Telling everything in the end may work in the detective novels, but it does not work in fantasy, especially not after the big conflict has already been resolved. I want to understand what the conflict is all about to actually care about it and the characters caught into it. The great revelation in itself was also somewhat of a let-down. The setup was promising, but it was used more as an excuse, than as a great, unifying theme. Not to mention that all of it didn't even make that much sense. So in the end, <i>Last Argument of Kings</i> was let down by a combination of far-too-predictable twist and a weak background story that was delivered in an uninspiring way.<br /><br /><b>Joe Abercrombie</b> is clearly a talented writer. Unfortunately, based on the First Law trilogy, it seems that he is not a very interesting storyteller. To me, a truly memorable fantasy author should be both.",2
Damn Joe Abercrombie is a sick fuck...i like it,5
"<br />The last book in Abercrombie’s dark fantasy trilogy. Done. Dusted.<br /><br />It’s going to be a while before I’ve properly assimilated everything that happened over the course of the series. It’s quite something, and it’s well worth your time if you enjoy genre fiction.<br /><br /><u>Last Argument of Kings – thoughts</u><br /><br /><i>Strange and painful events seemed to follow in his wake like stray dogs barking behind the butcher’s wagon.</i><br /><br />Like I mentioned in one of my earlier reviews, it isn’t clear whether this wants to be (dark) heroic or (dark) high fantasy. It does contain elements of both; It’s very, <b>very</b> violent and bloody at times, but it also has moments of hush and awe. As expected, the action sequences are spectacularly impressive, especially any featuring Logen Ninefingers, or more particularly, The Bloody Nine.<br /><br /><i>[He] stood still and caught his breath, the sword hanging down by his side, the grip cold and wet in his clenched fist. He’d never been much of a one for moving until it was time. <br />“Best tell me your name, while you still got breath in you. I like to know who I’ve killed.”</i><br /><br />I’d be hard pressed to select just one word to describe Abercrombie’s writing, but something that did spring to mind was “<b>immediate</b>”. There is an intimacy and urgency to the prose that pulls the reader in, kicking and screaming, for better or worse, until everything is played out. At almost 700 pages in pretty small print this is no light read, and yet it’s over before you know it.<br /><br />The characterisation in this story and in this entry in particular, is extraordinary beyond my ability to describe. The POV characters are fairly ambiguous for the most part and you’re never <i>quite</i> sure just who is going to carry the day as the biggest bastard, or beloved, of the series. I think, though, that I’m not alone in being partial to master Ninefingers, who is easily one of the most bad-ass and provocative anti-heroes to grace (if you could call it that) the pages of a book. <br /><br /><i>It meant nothing to [the Bloody Nine] who men were, or what they had done. He was the Great Leveller, and all men were equal before him. His only care was to turn the living into the dead, and it was past time for the good work to begin.</i><br /><br />A word of honour has to go to Inquisitor Glokta, whose inner musings are a delight and whose story is rife with intrigue and delivers the most surprises.<br /><br /><i>It always amazes me, how swiftly problems can be solved, once you start cutting things off people.</i><br /><br />As with the previous books, there is a lot going on, mostly concerned with warfare. Siege, battle, bloodbath, siege: wash, rinse, repeat. Despite that, it remains a fascinating story that manages not to be overshadowed by the mayhem. The (extended) ending is likely the portion that readers will quibble over the most, but it’s a fantastic achievement all in all. Great stuff all round.<br /><br /><u>Addendum:</u><br />In a recent review of a different book I made a comment regarding the use of (crude) expletives during certain, um, scenes of intimacy. The same thing happens here, but it didn’t seem so out of place at all. This either makes me the biggest hypocrite in the universe, or this is just that good a book. <br /><br /><i>You have to be realistic about these things.</i> <br />",5

"<b>
  <i>“Mercy and weakness are the same thing in war, and there's no prize for nice behavior.”</i>
</b><br><br>When your two favorite characters in a book are a master torturer and a warrior who occasionally is filled with so much bloodlust that he forgets who he is and is as likely to kill a friend as much as a foe you really shouldn’t be surprised to have mixed feelings at the end of the series.<br><br><b>But I was surprised</b>. Maybe I’m too used to the series I’m reading ending by tying everything up neatly in a bow and giving out an appropriate number of Happily Ever Afters. I can’t really say that happened. There are some people who got what they deserved, others who got far more than they deserved and even more who did not get what they deserved at all. At the end I wasn’t sure how to feel. This is one of those stories that is going to stick with me and I’ll wonder what the characters went on to do long after the story ended.<br><br><a href=""http://s1267.photobucket.com/user/FionaFixit/media/group_zps71097398.jpg.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">

</a><br><br>I’m going to give Joe Abercrombie some props. <b>He made me love characters that I shouldn’t have liked at all.</b> I mean who loves the torturer in a story, but Glotka is one of my all-time favorite Anti-Heroes. I also adore Logan who sometimes goes on killing sprees and might kill his most trusted ally, still Logen Nine-fingers really made this story for me.<br><br>Say one thing for Joe Abercrombie, say he is never boring. I flew through the last half of this book needing to know what was going to happen. I was surprised by revelations that just kept coming. There was one character that I absolutely loved in prior books that I couldn’t believe how much I despised them by the end of this one.<br><br><b>
  <i>“But you love to play the good man, don't you? Do you know what's worse than a villain? A villain who thinks he's a hero. A man like that, there's nothing he won't do, and he'll always find himself an<br>excuse.”</i>
</b><br><br>I really do not want to give away anything about this story. I just ask that you go in with an open mind and be ready for a very wild and unconventional and always entertaining ride. <b>The ending to this trilogy is much like Abercrombie’s characters; complex, interesting, controversial and perfectly unapologetically flawed.</b> Maybe that doesn’t sound like a good thing but looking back on it now a week after I finished I really liked some of the chances he took with his story.<br><br>I really hope he revisits a few of these characters since he left it a little open for some of them in the future. I grew really attached to so many of the characters in the story and I really want to see them again.<br>",4
"<b> Action </b><br /><i>The Last Argument of Kings</i> is a great ending to a superb fantasy trilogy. Don’t think this fantasy as light and ethereal – no, think dark, brutal and bloody. There are battles and battles and battles to be fought, and the most crucial is between Logen Ninefingers and his old friend come-enemy Bethod in the North.<br /><br />This is just a wonderful trilogy that provides everything you need for a breathtaking page-turner. Great characters, a world of intrigue, battling nations, supernatural influences, enthralling landscape, entertaining dialogue, humour and the band of warriors including Logan Ninefingers, Ferro and Jezel, led by Bayaz, the First of the Magi. The characters are highly capable in battle but also vulnerable, they make good decisions and bad, and they inflict damage and suffer pain. The writing style is a perfect pace and balance for the adventurous plot and the descriptive content with the characters and landscape.<br /><br />There are a lot of parallels to Game of Thrones but it does have its own place. I would highly recommend the trilogy and the entertainment through each book is tremendous.",5
"<i>“The only difference between war and murder is the number of the dead.”</i><br /><br />A fitting end to the trilogy, and yet the end seems rather pointless. These books are pageturners, they're sometimes funny, and they're mostly highly enjoyable, but there always seems to be something missing. Some deeper meaning. Some focus beyond just subverting tropes for cheap laughs.<br /><br />Watching Bayaz' plans unfold is, in the end, what this trilogy has to offer, but fortunately it is indeed quite the enjoyable exercise.<br /><br /><i>“Power makes all things right. That is my first law, and my last. That is the only law that I acknowledge.”</i>",4
"<i>You can find <a href=""https://wp.me/pa0WBY-zx"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">this</a> review and more at <a href=""http://novelnotions.net"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Novel Notions</a>. </i><br /><br />I’ve read some dark stuff in my life, but <b>I believe that <i>Last Argument of Kings</i> is the bleakest, most brutal book I’ve read, ever.</b> Joe Abercrombie undoubtedly earned his title as the King of Grimdark. If it wasn’t for the humor Abercrombie had been deftly layering into the story since <i>The Blade Itself</i>, I don’t know that I could’ve finished this final installment. I joked with my fellow Novel Notions bloggers that I felt like I needed to bathe in kittens and rainbows when I read the last pages, and that honestly wasn’t far from the truth. I started half a dozen or more books in the aftermath of this book, only to put them down again because they weren’t bright enough. I finally settled on rereading a Nora Roberts trilogy that I’ve read over and over since my teenage years. Nora’s charming descriptions of Ireland could not be further removed from the Union and the North and Gurkhul as Abercrombie detailed them.<br /><blockquote>“I have learned all kinds of things from my many mistakes. The one thing I never learn is to stop making them.”</blockquote> <br /><b>If <i>Before They Are Hanged</i> was a study in character development, in how people can grow dramatically in the face of adversity, <i>Last Argument of Kings</i> was a demonstration of how quickly those developments can be thrown by the wayside and how easily characters can slip back into old habits.</b> People who had genuinely changed found that those changes weren’t strongly rooted enough to sustain. It felt like the plot was propelled almost entirely by one betrayal after another. I didn’t expect a happy ending, I really didn’t. I mean, you have to be realistic about these things, after all. But I didn’t expect to hate nearly everything about the ending, either. A scant few characters found themselves in a decent place as the book drew to a close, and even those endings were heavily tempered with disappointment.<br /><blockquote>“If you want to be a new man you have to stay in new places, and do new things, with people who never knew you before. If you go back to the same old ways, what else can you be but the same old person?</blockquote> <br /><b>Abercrombie also succeeded in crafting perhaps the single evilest character I’ve ever experienced. </b> The full extent of said evil was shocking to me, as it was in no way apparent when the character was first introduced. Their callousness in regards to the value of human life was appalling, though it’s a trait that I should’ve anticipated as I look back. Even though I was shocked by this revelation, I had to respect how elaborate and well executed their plan was. There was one character who managed to surprise me with their decency, but I’ll refrain from naming them.<br /><blockquote>“People would far rather be handed an easy lie than search for a difficult truth, especially if it suits their own purposes.”</blockquote> <br /><b>There were a couple of chapters that, though blood soaked, exhibited some amazing technique from the author.</b> A duel scene, which is possibly the best such scene I’ve ever read, managed to be horrifying in content and almost breathtakingly beautiful at the same time. The language used was incredibly impressive and demonstrated that Abercrombie is not only a gifted storyteller, but a phenomenal craftsman. I was also highly impressed with a chapter entitled “Sacrifices.” Almost every perspective character was present in this single chapter, and Abercrombie made an artistic decision that I found delightful. Whatever line ended one perspective was also the opening line of the next perspective. It was a fun and thoughtful addition that I appreciated immensely.<br /><blockquote>“Rules are for children. This is war, and in war the only crime is to lose.”</blockquote> <br />While this book was painful to read, I have incredible respect for what Abercrombie managed to do in the First Law trilogy. <b>It might’ve been brutal, but it was engaging and suspenseful and, even when I was disappointed in the characters’ decisions, I still cared about them.</b> That’s a difficult balance to strike, and Abercrombie did it was great finesse. There were also an impressive amount of surprises, though few of them were happy. I’ve heard that his standalone novels set in the same world aren’t quite as bleak. I very much look forward to reading these, though I’ll be giving myself a breather before approaching them. <br /><blockquote>“Round and round in circles we go, clutching at successes we never grasp, endlessly tripping over the same old failures. Truly, life is the misery we endure between disappointments.”</blockquote> <br />Oddly enough, I believe that the First Law trilogy is now among my favorite fantasy series I’ve read. But, unlike others in this category, I’m not sure it’s a trilogy I’ll be rereading, as most of the other series among my favorites have been or will be. <b>I loved the characters and would definitely like to revisit them, but I don’t know if this last book in particular is one I could stomach a second time.</b> While <i>Last Argument of Kings</i> was written and executed brilliantly, the difficulty I had in reading it kept me from giving it the full 5 stars I know it deserves. If you consider yourself a fan of the grimdark subgenre but have somehow never read this trilogy, that’s an oversight that undoubtedly needs to be remedied. But if you struggle with darker fiction, you might want to steer clear of the First Law. You’ve been warned.",4
"This review is for all three books in the First Law trilogy. I was set to name this as the greatest fantasy trilogy that I've ever read. And yet the ending hit me so hard that I just can't muster up the enthusiasm that I had halfway through Book 3. Not to say that this isn't brilliant in so many ways. And while I respect the view of humanity as an honest and not unreasonable critique, it's hard to be quite as enthusiastic about something that, in the end, is so dark. Viewing our current society, from Hitler to Trump, it's clear that power and selfishness dominates. But unfortunately, as a thematic conclusion, it's depressing. Truth hurts.<br /><br />That said, this is one of the most <i>compelling</i> fantasy trilogies that I've ever read. It's merciless and brutal, but for all that, it feels honest. Abercrombie does just about everything right. The characters are all fascinating and compelling. They are believable and yet also surprising. Sometimes they make choices exactly as you expect, and other times they are driven by motives that were just under the surface, which you didn't recognize. The dialogue is excellent and realistic. The plot is complex and never boring yet not overwhelming. Abercrombie masterfully, and I mean masterfully, ratchets up the tension slowly and carefully. The drama builds and builds and builds, to a point where I was literally shouting at the book. I <i>had</i> to know what happened next, and it had to happen quickly. He manages atmosphere quite well, with diverse tones ranging across heartless cruelty, ironic comedy, awkward realism, and eerie horror. Something that seems obvious but I have found to be a weakness for many authors is actual physical movement and physical struggles. Abercrombie is quite good at describing all the physical aspects of movement, human contact, fighting and warfare. Even his sex scenes aren't ludicrous because they are uniquely character based. The overall fantasy worldbuilding is outstanding. Everything holds together as a concrete and coherent place. Thematically, Abercrombie seems to be exploring what forces drive us human animals. And whether there is an opportunity for us to become ""better."" More humane humans, if you will. His answer in the end is, well...not really. With some nuance, there are opportunities. If the weather is right and the world gives you a window...briefly. But the opportunity and timing is rare, and given the more typical unfairness that life has to offer, it brings out the selfishness inside everyone. We each do just what we think we <i>have</i> to do. Abercrombie also explores gender relations to interesting effect. He manages to create strong female characters, and yet show how they are trapped and controlled by patriarchal society. Hello Kavanaugh. Oh, and we shouldn't forget social class and wealth, which is another thematic area Abercrombie investigates.<br /><br />This 3,000+ page story follows a diverse group of individuals through a story that sprawls across a couple years. Two wars are fought almost simultaneously along with a mission to retrieve a powerful magical artifact that could turn the tide of the battles. One country is facing off against two enemies and political intrigue dogs every step of the struggle. Magical forces have taken sides as well. You'll find yourself surprised by the twists and turns this series takes. I certainly was.<br />The main characters encompass: a powerful and pompous ancient wizard, a barbarian (of sorts) and one of the greatest fighters alive who can speak to spirits, a female with a demonic ancestor in her past who is also a great warrior, an arrogant soldier of noble birth and his friend, a skilled soldier of common birth and his sister, who is strong-willed, witty and aggressive. And last but not least, the most sympathetic torturer that you are likely to ever encounter in literature. Yes, truly, you will be rooting for this torturer to succeed throughout the entire series.<br /><br />In the end, most of the story threads are resolved and come together in a way that overall satisfies...although as we know, life isn't fair so Abercrombie leaves us with a few intentionally unresolved events and an uncertain future. I <i>just</i> did a little interwebs research and discovered there is another trilogy set to continue this story. Well, well. We shall see.<br /><br />I was truly blown away by this series and highly recommend it to any fans of fantasy. Or for those readers interested in taking a dip into an incredibly well-crafted and literary fantasy series (as long as you don't turn away from some brutal violence). This is a great work that stands outside the mainstream of fantasy.",5
"[4.5/5 stars] This was easily the best one yet!<br><br>And I kind of ruined the experience for myself. By not planning ahead well enough to actually get through my library hold before it was due back, I had to stop part way though and wait three months to get it again… I swear I should’ve just bought it then and there, but I’m stubborn). In any case, the fact that I was interrupted right in the middle of all the action and <i>still</i> managed to be just as invested several months later is a testament to how good it was.<br><br>The brilliance of this series is in the characters. They’re not just flawed. Oh no, they all, each and every one of them, go beyond just merely flawed into completely f#cked up territory… and that’s why they’re so fascinating. Even Logan, who many highlight as their favorite character, has some deep psychological issues. By far, my favorite character is Sand dan Glokta. I’ve said it before, but I’ll continue to torture you with repetition – I’m in constant awe how a character who, on paper, should be considered completely deplorable manages to not only delight me, but have me rooting for him the entire way. His sardonic, practical views of the world are brilliantly represented, and I find myself laughing out loud at the most inappropriate times (like during torture scenes). It’s really not funny, but at the same time it’s hysterical… Abercrombie’s ability to create such a juxtaposition of emotions within scenes is truly masterful.<br><br>I like the culmination of events in this one, and the fact that nothing went the way I was expecting it to. Another of Abercrombie’s strengths is that he doesn’t stick to the formulaic storytelling prominent in the genre. This series is a unique creation told in its unique way, and I love that he stayed consistently true to his perspective through the whole thing. Although I was on the fence after the first book, these last two have convinced me beyond a doubt that this series is worth every bit of praise it gets. I wish I’d read it ages ago (I’ve owned it so long), but at least now I have several other unread Abercrombie novels to look forward to.<br><br>Recommendations: this trilogy-ender has convinced me that this series deserves its place as a fantasy genre staple. Not only does it have one of my favorite characters of all-time, it’s completely unapologetic in execution. This is not a feel-good tale. It’s dark, gritty, and violent. Yet I loved it, and I can’t wait to read on.<br><br>Via The Obsessive Bookseller at <a href=""https://www.NikiHawkes.com"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">www.NikiHawkes.com</a><br><br>Other books you might like:<br><a href=""https://goodreads.com/book/show/15790883.Promise_of_Blood__Powder_Mage___1_"" title=""Promise of Blood (Powder Mage, #1) by Brian McClellan"" rel=""noopener"">

"Secrets revealed! Plots twisting here and there! Maybe you could outguessed some of plots? The good news is even if you did outguessed a plot, it didn't make the story less fun. Some of the plot twists were actually simple, but the author's execution skill is marvelous. Oh yeah, your memory that still held the details of book one would be rewarded handsomely on this book.<br /><br /><br /><br />",5
"Oh, look, this is five stars as well, imagine that! (Please feign faux being shocked) <br /><br />Look, I honestly don’t think anything I’m going to say here is anything that hasn’t been expounded on before, but Lord have mercy, it must be conveyed in some shape/form/fashion. <br /><br />There’s a reason Abercrombie is considered a master of his genre; this book, in my opinion, takes that and sums it so very excellently. Abercrombie takes these vivid real characters, characters placed in extraordinary situations. However, you still somehow empathize, loathe, hate, or are shocked as they are, and therefore these characters are relatable even to us in our “normal” lives. <br /><br />The twists, the turns, the blows, you feel them in real-time with this unlikely band of players right up until the very end. Every time I thought, “Ah, he’s going to put a nice bow on this situation, and who can blame him? These characters deserve it.” he teases that lacy ribbon across your body until you’re about begging to be mummified in it. He pulls the whole damn thing away for another surprise. <br /><br />This novel is fantasy, philosophy, entertainment, emotions, and characters that are so realistic it’s hard at times to remember this is a made-up story. However, their decisions, motives, and faults all make sense at some level, and often you’ll find yourself rooting for someone once you understand their reasons, even if they were on your shit list from previous volumes. <br /><br />“A man can change.” - Logen ‘Ninefingers’, all I can say to that I raise my glass and say yes, yes he can.",5
"- What some people seem to find hard to understand is that there's a part of you, in fact the most important part, that's immaterial and immortal. Your body is really no more than a temporary shell for the immortal part, and houses it for a little while until it dies. But what you do during that short time is very important. If you live well, the immortal part of you will become absorbed in something much bigger than you are. It will grow and change and achieve things that you can't even dream of. Start thinking of life in these terms, and you will have a completely new perspective on it.<br /><br />- Hey, I didn't know you believed in—<br /><br />- In genes? Well of course I do.

"Didactic, patronizing, condescending and arguably neo-intellectual twaddle. I do not believe in a God, certainly not any God that's been conceived by man, but I also believe Richard Dawkins is a self-satisfied thought-Nazi who is as fundamental in his view of religion as any right-wing minister. Fundamentalists of all faiths scare me, and atheism is just as much a faith as any religion. The existence or non-existence of a God cannot be proven, nor can the existence or non-existence of a soul, and faith is an abstract experience with implications that are fundamentally unresponsive to study. As such, pursuits like Dawkins' often boil down to one type of faith (in ""reason"") vs. another type of faith (in a ""God""). Many people love Dawkins. He is certainly intelligent, and writes as such, but he lacks wisdom and imagination. To me, that's the flaw in all of his work, from The Selfish Gene to The God Delusion. The idea that one human being can know enough about the nature of the universe to make the sweeping declarations Dawkins' makes is preposterous to me, and no more credible than the sweeping declarations of Jerry Falwell or Pat Robertson.<br /><br />NC",1
"If you are bored look up the Community Reviews, sort by 1-star. They are very entertaining. One of them as a uni professor advising a student to burn down the book store where they bought this book. Then we have the creationists, then the person who thinks it is all a capitalist manifesto. There are those who think he is arrogant, depraved, uses philistine language (!) ... <br /><br />How can anyone be a creationist and not believe in dinosaurs and such? Do they believe that the earth is flat? Are they the sort of people who pay astrologers money to cast their charts because of course your fate is determined by the stars at the moment of your birth? Jesus wept. Or he would have. I'm reading Josephus at the moment, it seems that the only mention of Jesus at the time he was living was in Josephus but that it might have been added later... That's a whole other story, and one which Dawkins might have liked, but these one-star creationists certainly won't.",4
"Although I consider myself a Jesus-loving, god-fearing, creationist, I simply LOVE reading about evolution. I'm not sure what it is, but I find the whole concept, when explained by a lucid and accessible author, fascinating. And Dawkins is nothing if not lucid and accessible. He presents the topic and various questions and scientific controversies in a way that anybody with a willingness to pay attention can follow it. Some of the chapters were a bit more of a slog as Dawkins has to resort to scary scary math and numbers to prove some of his points and set up for even more mindblowing stuff in future chapters. But most of the time, this book is chock full of insanely interesting examples and user-friendly analogies. Dawkins sure knows his way around language too. One of my favorite lines is: ""Sex: that bizarre perversion of straightforward replication.""<br /><br />On the science of it all, as I said, I'm a creationist, but I like to read up on the other side and at least understand, if not appreciate, what their take on the matter is. And to read Dawkins is to realize, yes, this does sound like a very solid theory. My one stumbling block to getting onto the evolution train one hundred percent is time. Perhaps my comprehension of just how long hundred million years is is faulty, but I just can't wrap my mind around how all of these ACCIDENTAL mutations, with no conscious will on the part of the group, individual or gene itself, could possibly result in the complexity of life as we see it now. There is an adage that if you gave an infinite number of monkeys an infinite number of typewriters and an infinite amount of time, they would eventually produce the complete works of Shakespeare. To believe evolution is to believe that you now have a FINITE amount of monkeys and a FINITE amount of time and yet they STILL manage to produce the complete works of Shakespeare... and they do it OVER AND OVER AND OVER again. Just doesn't seem plausible. But perhaps further reading will sway me at a later date.<br /><br /><br />EDIT 6/3/15<br />I can't believe this review is still getting attention after all this time! And I love the thread that has developed in the comments. I should let you all know though that as of 2008 I have been living on the side of reason and rationality. I became an atheist after a LOT of reading and contemplating of the Bible (the link to my ""de-conversion"" story is down in the comments as well). I try these days to, as much as possible, follow the evidence wherever it leads. Additionally Dawkins' ""The Ancestor's Tale"" was one of THE most beautiful books I've ever read. Check out my review if you're interested.",4
"I read the 30th anniversary edition of this book--it is a true ""classic"". I note that there are over 48,000 ratings and 1,400 reviews of this book on Goodreads! Richard Dawkins put an entirely original slant on Darwin's theory of natural selection. The book has turned people around, to the understanding that the gene plays the single most central role in natural selection, rather than the individual organism. Over the course of generations, evolution plays a role to ensure the survival of the genes, not the individual or ""the species"".<br><br>Although the book is 30 years old, it has stood the test of time. There are a few passages--primarily about computers--that are 30 years out of date. But the vast majority of the book seems to have held up quite well.<br><br>Dawkins' prose is very approachable by the layman. There is a bare minimum of technical jargon--quite different from most other books about genetics that I've been reading in recent years. Dawkins takes the time to explain things, often with appropriate metaphors. There are very few diagrams in the book--additional figures could help clarify some points, in my opinion.<br><br>Much of the book is really about the role of game theory, in understanding genetics. Dawkins devotes several chapters to describe how various traits controlled by genes are held in an ESS-- ""Evolutionarily Stable Strategy""--a term that Dawkins uses quite often, that I think is a synonym for the game theory term ""stable equilibrium"". Dawkins shows how an ESS is approached over the course of ""iterations"" of a game, that is to same, over many generations. These chapters were especially interesting to me, as I recently took an online course on the subject of game theory.<br><br>It is in this book that Dawkins coined the now-famous term ""meme"". The meme is a cultural analog of the biological gene. A meme seeks to self-perpetuate, and mutates if that aids its self-preservation. Dawkins devotes an entire fascinating chapter to his concept of the meme.<br><br>Throughout the book, Dawkins deals with the dichotomy between the ""selfishness"" required for survival, and the ""altruism"" of human behavior. How do we explain altruism? Dawkins explores this dilemma over and over again, showing in virtually every case how the selfishness of genes can help to explain apparent altruistic behavior of the individual. <br><br>This is an absolutely fascinating book. I highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in genetics, evolution, or sociology.<br><br><img src=""https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1403140008i/10046084.jpg"" width=""400"" class=""gr-hostedUserImg"" loading=""lazy""> ",5
"Richard Dawkins shot to celebrity in 1976 with this rabble-rousing book, which change the game by inventing the word ""meme"" and basically nothing else, the rest of his ideas range from ""ehhh not exactly"" to ""yeah but so what."" Fun to read though! The gist is that the essential unit of life is the gene; our bodies are just big fleshy protection robots for the gene. Dawkins says I'm a tool. Right? High five!<br /><br />And you might be like ""Okay, so who cares?"" What difference does that make, right? Well, first of all I'm gonna go have some pie because fuck you, genes, you're not the boss of me. Woohoo! Other than that, no, no difference, carry on. It makes a difference to scientists, because when you look at it this way all kinds of behaviors make more sense, or make sense in a different way. Dawkins' particular focus is on behaviors we call ""altruistic"", like when an antelope warns his herd about an approaching lion. Dawkins would like to go through every altruistic behavior he can think of, which is a lot, and show you why it's actually not at all altruistic. <br /><br />(The antelope is an easy one: he warns the herd by jumping up and down, which doubles as a sign to the lion that he is super bouncy and the lion should go chase someone less bouncy.)<br /><br />So, no big surprise to those of us who know Dawkins in his latest incarnation as The World's Dickishest Atheist:* Dawkins does a lot of party pooping in this book. Did you think you were a nice guy? You are not. Your genes command you to behave nicely on occasion because in the end it will benefit you. (See: the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Prisoner's Dilemma;</a> also game theory. Or read this book, which will explain both to you.)<br /><br /><i>* which is more annoying to religious people, but also annoying to those of us who are atheists but don't feel the need to yell about it all the time</i><br /><br />But Dawkins is a tremendously engaging writer. He's good at explaining technical concepts clearly. And he's funny! This book is fun to read. And it's full of the kind of fascinating tidbits that make you turn to your spouse and say ""Holy moley, did you know saddleback birds on an island in New Zealand make up new songs that then spread through the population like a Pharrell Williams single until everyone's singing them?"" And she's like ""Sounds boring! I'm reading Jezebel, did you know Justin Bieber was racist when he was fourteen?"" and then the two of you look at each other like who even <i>are</i> you? And your genes are like who cares, you two should make out.",5
"Color me very impressed. I can now see why this is considered to be one of those hugely popular science books I keep hearing about and the reason why Dawkins has become so widely known and/or respected with or without his notoriety.<br /><br />Indeed, the pure science bits were pretty much awesome. We, or at least I, have heard of this theory in other contexts before and none of it really comes as much surprise to see that genes, themselves, have evolved strategies that are exactly the same as Game Theory in order to find the best possible outcome for continued replication. Hence: the selfish gene.<br /><br />Enormous simple computers running through the prisoner's dilemma with each other, rival genes, and especially within whole organisms which could just be seen as gigantic living spacecraft giving the genes an evolutionary advantage of finding new and more prosperous adaptations. <br /><br />Yup! That's us!<br /><br />I honestly don't see the problem. I love the idea that we are just galaxies of little robots running complicated Game Theories that eventually turn into a great cooperative machine where everyone (mostly) benefits, with plenty of complicated moves going way beyond hawks and doves and straight into the horribly complicated multi-defectors, forgivers, and other evolutionary styles that depend on the events that have gone before and the pre-knowledge (or lack of) a set end-date for the entire experiment... in other words, our deaths, whether pre-planned or simply the entire mass of genes just coming to realize that it's no longer in their best interest to keep pushing this jalopy around any longer if they're not getting anything out of it... like further replication. :)<br /><br />Even when it's not precisely sex, it's still all about sex. :)<br /><br />Of course, what I've just mentioned isn't the entire book, because, as a matter of fact, the book walks us through so many stages of thought, previous research, developments, mistakes, and upgraded theories and surprising conclusions based on soooooo much observable data that any of us might be rightfully confounded with the weight of it unless we were in the heart of the research, ourselves.<br /><br />It's science, baby.<br /><br />Make sure you don't make the data conform to your theory. Build your theory from observable data. Improve upon it as the building blocks are proved or disproved, keep going until it is so damn robust until nothing but a true miracle could topple it, and then keep asking new questions.<br /><br />The fact is, this theory has nothing (or everything) to do with our lives. We play Game Theory, too, in exactly the same way every gene everywhere does, but we just happen to be able to make models on top of the situations and we're able to choose whether to see through the lies, the hawk strategies, or when to stop cooperating if the advantages work out much better for us if we did. We, like our genes, can choose long-term cooperative strategies or play everything like a Bear market. :)<br /><br />Even this book says that it's very likely that Nice Guys can win, but just like our lives, the gene lives keep discovering ever more complicated strategies and all eventual strategies become more and more situational. <br /><br />Isn't that us, to a tea? I wonder if most complaints about this book stem from complaints about Game Theory rather than the perceived conclusion (much better spelled out, not in this book, but in later books)... that atheism rules the day. It really isn't evident here. Instead, we have a macrocosm mimicking the microcosm and no one wants to challenge their comfortable world view. <br /><br />Things aren't simple. All choices to betray or cooperate are then met with situation and memory and ever complex meta-contexts, the difference between us and genes being that we're self-aware and the genes are not.<br /><br />Yes, yes, I see where the arguments can start coming out of the closet about self-determination and such, but that's not really the point of this book at all. The point is that it's a successful model that accurately describes reality. It has nothing at all to do with the macro-world except obliquely, and makes no value judgments on our art, our beliefs, or how we think about ourselves except in our uniquely stubborn and self-delusional ways that love to take things out of context and apply misunderstood concepts to our general lives and wonder why everything gets so screwed up. :)<br /><br />But then, maybe I'm just applying my own incomplete models to yet another and we lousy humans still lack WAY TOO MUCH data to build a really impressively improved model. :) <br /><br />Come on, Deep Thought. Where are you? :)",5
"The Selfish Gene (1976) is exactly how I prefer my non-fiction science books to be written. Richard Dawkins is clear, stays on topic, and explains the necessary details and complexities using simple everyday life examples. Dawkins, is entertaining, and gives you a hand when you get lost in his genetic pool analysis. <br /><br />His writing talks to me. His argumentation challenge and encourage me to think and feel that I am gaining knowledge. It's a rewarding read. The author discusses the plants, animals, and humans selfish gene and their evolution by means of natural selection. There is no moral of the story as morals are not considered in the natural selection process.<br /><br />What roll did natural selection have on primordial Earth? It selected to retain the stable forms of molecules and throw out the unstable forms. During the same period, simple replicating molecules were present with a capability to replicate themselves. Today we have a far more sophisticated self-replicating molecule, containing a complex recipe, called the DNA. Such stable molecules started to compete with one another in a struggle for existence. In order to increase their chances of survival and reproduction, these stable replicating molecules built machines for survival in which they would be accommodated. Those stable molecules today are our genes, and the machines for their survival, our bodies.<br /><br />What is a selfish gene? The selfish gene is a short or rather small piece of a chromosome that lasts for many generations and has an extremely low probability to split up. It collaborates well with other genes and does not allow anything to penetrate it. The long lasting life of the selfish gene makes it an important unit of evolution by means of natural selection, and the replicating molecule (gene) a fundamental unit of natural selection.<br /><br />The selfish gene created us to be self-centered and not altruistic. Our genes created us for their well-being and to fight for their survival and reproduce them through procreation. The selfish gene in living organisms is concerned for itself and individual in which they are housed. Therefore, our genes have a more egocentric approach for self-survival rather than an altruistic one that would benefit the group. Altruism is not the most stable evolutionary strategy for the genes and individuals, unless reciprocal altruism is at hand that would benefit each variety (of course there are exceptions). Parental altruism towards children can be viewed as genes investing in themselves as their genes are now found in their offspring. That is why it is important to teach altruism to our children, as it doesn't necessarily come naturally.<br /><br />But our brain has developed up to a point that we are in a position to reject or rebel against our own selfish gene. Many people choose not to have children or use contraceptives and this way disobey the selfish gene. Others sacrifice themselves for the benefit of a group, for an ideal or a cause. In one chapter we see how a ""meme"" (idea or behavior), a unit of culture, acts as a replicator that is transmitted from individual to individual.<br /><br />Since humans are conscious beings and aware that a future exists, it gives us the power to simulate and plan ahead. Also, we have written accounts of the past events - history. I would certainly hope that with our increasing knowledge about our genes, our finer capability of forecasting, and written history from different points of view, can act as tools to help us find a better balance between the common good of a society and the individuals interest i.e. balancing altruism and selfishness.",5
"Last night, while watching a fusillade of pyrotechnic spermatozoa ejaculated from gaudy tubes of erectile aspect, I saw the whole of human desire captured in Incarusian defiance. With shells striving to pierce the black ovum of space, but having their motility sapped by the deformational geometries which encircle our terrestrial biosphere. Disclosing their metal salts and iron filings with violent punctuations of barometric pressure and visual amplitude, only to be completely consumed, mere seconds later, by silence and darkness. A stranger, perhaps sensing the melancholy which had gripped me by the haunches, innocently inquired, “Is something bothering you, sweetie?” To which I hissed, “I sometimes fantasize about blasting a champagne cork into someone’s mouth, mid sentence, then impaling them with the bill of sword fish.” I then turned back to the show, shaking my head, “You didn’t deserve that. I’m just thinking about the relationship between senescence and antagonistic pleiotropy and how you can’t make sense of certain biological realities unless your conceptual efforts proceed from the optimal level of granularity. For instance, when I, as a little girl, had the distinct terror of being chased by a Somali ostrich, and was subsequently trampled by said flightless bird, with my large strawberry milkshake pinned beneath me and exploding all over my white dress like a bazooka bubblegum claymore, (which appeared to onlookers as my ever loving guts being mashed out of my tiny body), it did not behoove me to attempt to understand its behavior at the level of quantum physics. I’m sure the whole dreary affair transgressed no physical laws, up to and including my mother screaming; “Saints be with us! The little idiot has finally done herself in!” I’m not saying that. But it was a far better use of attentional resources to focus on my behavior prior to the incident, wherein I was strangely compelled to harangue the temperamental bird about the dimorphic condition of its tiny head relative to its large body.” Laughing and turning to ask the man for a light, I realized that he had fled silently back into the crowd.<br /><br />Not to be thwarted in mid rant, I singled out an attractive woman and stormed towards her, gesturing wildly as if the Cesar of my ego was experiencing bloody death curtesy of white hot senatorial stabbings administered by psychedelics. Shouting, “In precisely this way, it is difficult to make much sense of our ephemeral existence without the concept of antagonistic pleiotropy.” Drawing painfully close and smelling her hair. “Are you single? Don’t answer that! First, observe, at the proper level of magnification, the center of evolution’s dramas, not the individual, but the gene. Now, if we are going to attempt to understand death, this inability of ours to achieve the escape velocity of our mortality, like those mortars which currently spunk the night sky with their rainbow smithereens. To understand this spectral Bukkake, we must cudgel the knees of our tired frameworks and streak madly into the arms of lusty new paradigms. Observe! If we were going to ask the obvious question; why do we perish amongst abundance? Why must we bust a fat, prismatic nut, and never be heard again? If we have food sufficient to meet our caloric needs, should we not be able to repair the damage we incur indefinitely? I say unto you; Let us suppose that there was a gene, in our ancestral past, which controlled for more than one phenotypic trait (i.e the protein expression of the genotype under influence of environment factors). One of these traits was quite beneficial early in life and ensured that the humans who possessed it were more likely to take it to pound town, but the same gene was also responsible for one or more defects which would manifest outside of prime reproductive years. You would end up with a proliferation of these genes irregardless of their ultimate cost, (i.e the eventual demise of the screaming mortar as it goes ungently into that good night) because reproduction is key. The mystery of senescence now seems tractable, doesn’t it?” <br /><br />Silently she takes my hand and leads me away from the crowd. Once we’ve made it to the top of a small hill overlooking the celebration, she turns to me and says;<br /><br />""Sì, abbiamo un'anima. Ma è fatta di tanti piccoli robot.”<br /><br />This book is an account of one of the most successful science metaphors ever created, of how immortal genes are winnowed through the game theoretic calculus of natural selection into evolutionary stable states. About how the non-random survival of randomly varying replicators can produce all the various strategies which enable the carriers of this encoded information to survive and send it into the future. The Selfish Gene is one of the best books on evolution ever written. It profoundly communicates just what evolution is all about: the replication of genetic units of information, by whatever means possible. Viruses, retroviruses, parasitic insects, gut bacteria, mitochondria, the grotesque nuptial gifts of scorpion flies, and motorcycle accidents caused by toxoplasmosis - they are all successful cases of genes replicating in varied ""survival machines,"" giving zero shits about how quaint their respective venues appear. It's an amazing, well-proved idea, wonderfully communicated by a passionate writer. It requires no advanced training or technical background to understand, and will reward your attention by permanently enriching your understanding of the natural world.",5
"On 27 December 1831, a young naturalist by the name of Charles Robert Darwin set upon a voyage of discovery on the <i>HMS Beagle</i> which was to last five years and take him all over the globe. He came back with a lot of specimens, copious scientific notes and an explosive theory which was to rock the world of ideas: the theory of evolution by natural selection. Suddenly, God became an unnecessary and unlikely hypothesis: man was pulled down from his high throne as the master of creation: and existence became a cacophony of chance events rather than a carefully co-ordinated orchestra. Naturally, the religious establishment rebelled. But like all ideas whose time had come, evolution hung on with great tenacity to become the widely accepted idea it is today.<br><br>I have been fascinated with the idea ever since I was introduced to it in high school. As far as I am concerned, the very argument that theists put forward against evolution is its greatest strength; viz. the complexity of the natural world. According to the believer, such a complex and “perfect” (whatever that means!) system has to have an architect behind it. But the fact is that it is not “perfect” – nature is dynamic. What we perceive as stability is homeostasis, a seething mass of life, eating one another and being eaten; and as nature shifts her stance, so does life, whole species dying out (like the dinosaurs) to make way for others.<br><br>But wait! Humans are different, aren’t we? We compete, true: but we also show altruism. People lay down their life to protect their progeny, their brothers and sisters, their countrymen… if we were selfish survival machines, why would we do this? It means we have the spark of divinity within us, doesn’t it?<br><br>Well… not exactly, according to Richard Dawkins. It only means we have the “Selfish Gene” within us.<br><br><i>The Selfish Gene</i> needs no introduction. This is one of those iconic “pop” science books which everyone seems to have read, like The Naked Ape by Desmond Morris. I was a bit late (well, about 37 years!) in getting to it. However, the book has lost none of the charm, and the idea any of its power, due to the ravages of time: if at all, it has become stronger.<br><br><b>What is a gene?</b><br><br>Dawkins confesses that there is no universally agreed definition of ‘gene’. We now know that the blueprint for building of each human being is coded in 23 pairs of chromosomes, one of every pair being inherited from each parent. The code inside the chromosome is written in DNA molecules, the famous ‘Double Helix’ that Dawkins terms the ‘Immortal Coils’.<br><br><img src=""https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1390079322i/8139978._SX540_.jpg"" class=""gr-hostedUserImg"" loading=""lazy""><br><br>The DNA molecules are replicators. They replicate themselves; they also manufacture proteins, the basic building block of life as we know it. These DNA molecules (some version of them) were the original “life” in the “primeval soup”: they reproduced themselves and competed with one another to survive. Natural selection defined which lasted and which died away.<br><br>Dawkins defines a gene (a definition borrowed from G. C. Williams) as “any part of chromosomal material that potentially lasts for enough generations to serve as a unit of natural selection”. In other words, a gene is a copier with high “copying-fidelity”: that is, it ensures that it copies itself without mistakes so that longevity in the form of copies is ensured.<br><br>So in the primeval soup, these genes went on happily competing with each other, evolving newer and newer ways of surviving in an environment which got increasingly complex. As part of survival technology, the genes built a lot of machines, bunching together to form gene complexes in the context. The machines got more and more complex, from the single-cell amoeba to the human being.<br><br>Dawkins starts the book with the question “Why are people?” This is his answer – so that the gene can survive and replicate. We are nothing but vehicles for the genes, who exist to ensure their survival.<br><br>Pretty disillusioning, isn’t it? But Dawkins is far from done. After pulling down humanity from its pedestal as the “pinnacle of creation”, he proceeds to explain all the lofty sentiments such as love, altruism, sacrifice etc. as the result of strategies for gene survival – extremely selfish strategies at that. It is very difficult to stomach for a generation which has been trained to behold human beings as somehow special, and the above sentiments as the proof of their exclusivity which separate them from the “lower” animals. As one disgusted poster said in one of the fora where this book was discussed: “So altruism is like going to the potty? Oh dear!”<br><br>But even though disheartening at first, as Dawkins begins to back up his arguments with solid scientific reasoning, it is difficult to dispute him, and difficult not to get excited when he presents his theory with mathematical precision.<br><br><b>Aggression and Stability</b><br><br>One of the most common arguments put forward against evolution is that an uncontrolled state of aggression will lead to a free-for-all and the “stable” environment we see cannot exist. Dawkins explains this with the concept of an ESS (Evolutionary Stable Strategy), which leads to a dynamic equilibrium or homeostasis: he posits a theoretical society populated by pure aggressors (“hawks”) and pure pacifists (“doves”), and proves logically that over a period of time, the number of hawks and doves will stabilise in roughly equal proportion. This is because it is not the survival machines which are having the final say on who will win: it is the genes. This concept is further expanded with fine variations on the behavior – ultimately, every time, a dynamically stable configuration results.<br><br>In Chapter 12, ‘Nice Guys Finish First’ (added as part of the second edition), Dawkins takes this theory further and presents a varying set of evolutionary strategies, modelled on Game Theory. It describes in detail various evolutionary stratagems he tried out on his computer (with contributions from a lot of scientists) and the outcomes. This is a fascinating analysis and in my opinion, the most interesting part of the book – but that may just be the engineer in me, who loves anything mathematical!<br><br><b>Altruism</b><br><br>Oh yes. The old stumbling block. The favourite saw of the creationists. If we are all selfish, how does altruism come into the picture? Why do parents sacrifice themselves for their children, why do siblings do the same for each other, why do we co-operate at all? Should we not be at each other’s throats, all the time?<br><br>No, according to Dawkins. If we look at it from the gene’s point of view, it all makes perfect sense.<br><br>When we are talking of genes, we are talking of gene pools here: a group of genes working together so that the survival of each is maximised. Dawkins makes a brilliant analogy to a rowing team. If a coach is choosing a team, he would over a period end up with a group who can pull in such a way that the winning chance is maximised – an individual rower, however brilliant he is, would find no place in the team if he did not contribute to the group effort. In the case of genes, natural selection plays the role of the coach. Those genes which could not co-operate simply get discarded in the evolutionary race over a period of time.<br><br>Also, one should bear in mind that a gene is not a single physical bit of DNA; it is all replicas of a particular bit of DNA, distributed throughout the world. A gene might be able to assist replicas of itself that are sitting in other bodies. If so, this could be the origin of altruism. Dawkins calls it ‘genesmanship’. He spends four chapters explaining how it applies to siblings, offspring, lovers and apparent strangers. In the last chapter (‘The Long Reach of the Gene’), Dawkins extrapolates the above argument to how the gene in one species can extend its reach to another species, possibly to the detriment of the latter, to explain parasitism.<br><br>One may take it or leave it, but the arguments are well thought-out and presented with great clarity; with cold, scientific logic. There are no opinions here. It makes fascinating reading, even though the mathematical analysis may put some off!<br><br><b>Memes</b><br><br>The concept of the ‘meme’ is possibly the most revolutionary one expressed in this book. Dawkins defines a meme as a unit of cultural transmission, a basic idea which gets replicated in human brains, in the ‘primeval soup’ of human culture; which, according to him, is in the same state as the biological ‘soup’ was at the dawn of life on earth. To quote the author himself:<br><br>Examples of memes are tunes, ideas, catch-phrases, clothes fashions, ways of making pots or of building arches. Just as genes propagate themselves in the gene pool by leaping from body to body via sperms or eggs, so memes propagate themselves in the meme pool by leaping from brain to brain via a process which, in the broad sense, can be called imitation.<br><br>According Dawkins, all prevalent ideas (including the idea of God!) is a meme: the meme survives because it has a survival value in the meme pool. If we subscribe to this idea, the whole intellectual arena is nothing but a group of memes grappling for survival – not a very edifying thought. It seems Dawkins appreciates this, because he ends the chapter on memes with the speculation that man has the capacity for genuine, disinterested, true altruism. He says “We are built as gene machines and cultured as meme machines, but we have the power to turn against our creators. We, alone on earth, can rebel against the tyranny of the selfish replicators.”<br><br>I, as a fan of the Jungian idea of the Collective Unconscious, could not help speculating on whether the meme could be embedded way down in the gene itself? Maybe the Collective Unconscious is nothing but little bits of consciousness, embedded inside the DNA, which guided the process of survival? If so, it could be case for Intelligent Design – or rather, Intelligent Evolution.<br><br>This is one of those ‘pop-science’ books which are enlightening and enjoyable at the same time. A must-read. <br><br>Read the review also on my <a href=""http://nandakishorevarma.wordpress.com/2013/12/13/a-review-of-the-selfish-gene-by-richard-dawkins"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">

"One of the most important things I took from <a href=""https://goodreads.com/book/show/61535.The_Selfish_Gene"" title=""The Selfish Gene by Richard Dawkins"" rel=""noopener""> The Selfish Gene</a> is an idea that I find a bit difficult to put into words. <a href=""https://goodreads.com/author/show/1194.Richard_Dawkins"" title=""Richard Dawkins"" rel=""noopener""> Richard Dawkins</a> is really good at crafting metaphors to describe scientific principles that on their own may be not be so interesting, or may be stubbornly inaccessible. While his rhetoric may make concepts more accessible and convenient to discuss, he openly warns that no metaphor is completely accurate. Understanding that the metaphors must be viewed skeptically, he offers this,<br /><br /><i>""If we allow ourselves the license of talking about genes as if they had conscious aims, always reassuring ourselves that we could translate our sloppy language back into repectable terms if we wanted to, we can ask the question, what is a single selfish gene trying to do?""</i><br /><br />All things being even, genes that are long-lasting or that replicate quickly, and genes that can replicate with high fidelity are going to outnumber those that are slow or erroneous in replication. Dawkins calls this the “selfish” nature of genetic replication. He chooses his words carefully though, and applies metaphors of self-interest only to genes that are, or are not, selected for by indifferent and unthinking mechanisms.<br /><br />Where this metaphor breaks down, as Dawkins admits, is when the idea of “selfishness” is brought up from genetics to the level of individuals within a group, or groups within a species. He criticizes such concepts in sociobiology, where claims are made that an individual’s actions are inherently selfish in order to serve their genes in themselves, or in other related individuals.<br /><br />While genes may be “selfish” in order to be selected, this doesn’t necessitate that individuals (“survival machines” as he so affectionately calls us) must as well act only in self-interest. In this video introduction to the book, Dawkins suggests that,<br /><br /><i>""…if you have “selfish” genes, which only means that natural selection works at the level of the gene, if you have “selfish” genes, then, you may have altruistic individuals.""</i>",4
"<b>Review 2022</b><br /><br />This was somewhat repetitious since I've read quite a few books on evolution since I last read this in April 2018 &amp; Dawkins takes pains in this, the 30th anniversary edition, to correct mistakes he made, updates others have made, &amp; to answer some of his critics. Some of the explanations seem needlessly pedantic until I realized just how subtle &amp; powerful his theory is. Even if it doesn't hold up in all circumstances (I'm not sure that it doesn't.) it has changed the field considerably by turning the point of view that preceded it on its collective head (group selection) &amp; influenced many other fields. <br /><br />So, it has become clear to me that this one is even more influential than I knew at the time. I keep finding references (usually for, but occasionally against) the idea of the selfish gene. I'm interested in reading more by <a href=""https://goodreads.com/author/show/31624.Edward_O__Wilson"" title=""Edward O. Wilson"" rel=""noopener"">Edward O. Wilson</a> who is one of those who disagrees with the idea. Wilson was also eminent in the field &amp; the finer points of their arguments are beyond me. This article takes a middling ground.<br /><a target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" href=""https://thisviewoflife.com/richard-dawkins-edward-o-wilson-and-the-consensus-of-the-many/"">https://thisviewoflife.com/richard-da...</a><br /><br />I've also just read a discussion of memes by <a href=""https://goodreads.com/author/show/6952980.Daniel_C__Dennett"" title=""Daniel C. Dennett"" rel=""noopener"">Daniel C. Dennett</a> in <a href=""https://goodreads.com/book/show/35167699.From_Bacteria_to_Bach_and_Back_The_Evolution_of_Minds"" title=""From Bacteria to Bach and Back The Evolution of Minds by Daniel C. Dennett"" rel=""noopener"">From Bacteria to Bach and Back: The Evolution of Minds</a>. It's not an area I'm terribly interested in, but I'd like to read Dawkins' take on it again. I think Dennett also codified his ideas of competence without comprehension, at least in part, from this work.<br /><br />Highly recommended to all. While I found the audiobook delightful, it's nice to have a text copy available to better grasp some of the more subtle points.<br /><br />-----------------<br /><b>April 2018 Review</b> This is the thirty year anniversary edition of the book (2006 rather than 1976) so it contains a lot of clarifications where he found there were misunderstandings. It also contains some corrections where he decided that he was either wrong or off target. He also mentions areas where other discoveries &amp; papers took his work even further. I think I found these the most enjoyable. It's great to see science in progress. He also added a few extra chapters that were fantastic.<br /><br />Of course, the main reason to read this book is to read the origin of the word <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">""Meme""</a> which Dawkins created &amp; loosed on the world in this book. I love origin stories.<br /><br />This is the third book that I've read written &amp; narrated by Dawkins. I liked it better than his autobiography, but not quite as much as <a href=""https://goodreads.com/book/show/14743.The_God_Delusion"" title=""The God Delusion by Richard Dawkins"" rel=""noopener"">The God Delusion</a>. I'm not an evolutionary biologist, so some of it went into more depth than I appreciated. It was always interesting &amp; easy to understand, though. That he could make such complex topics so easily digested by a layman says a lot about both his ability as a writer &amp; his knowledge of the subject.<br /><br />His primary point is that evolution is about gene survival. We &amp; other living beings are just the vehicles that the genes build to perpetuate themselves. He makes it very clear throughout the book that when he ascribes words such as 'selfish' to behavior that he is putting the behavior in human terms for ease of communication. When he didn't, he used math to show his point, but he didn't do a lot of that &amp; it was always easy to follow even when the points were counter-intuitive. There were a fair few of those.<br /><br />One example is the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Prisoner's Dilemma</a> problem &amp; how it relates to selfishness. He spent quite a bit of time on this &amp; even provided the results of several computer simulations done later by colleagues that prove out &amp; explain the differences in iterated games versus single games. Wow. It really explains a lot about symbiosis, herd/group, &amp; even cuckoos' behavior.<br /><br />I'm just plain impressed by this man &amp; his thought processes, but I'm not sure if I'll read any more of his books. He mentions where he goes into more detail in other books &amp; papers throughout this edition of this book, but he covers enough of <a href=""https://goodreads.com/book/show/61538.The_Extended_Phenotype_The_Long_Reach_of_the_Gene__Popular_Science_"" title=""The Extended Phenotype The Long Reach of the Gene (Popular Science) by Richard Dawkins"" rel=""noopener"">The Extended Phenotype: The Long Reach of the Gene</a> for me here, I think. Maybe not. It's an intriguing subject. Perhaps if I come across the audio version I'll succumb to temptation. He &amp; Lalla Ward do a great job of narrating &amp; the ideas are fascinating. <br /><br />It's amazing just how complex processes can arise out of such simple objects working in groups. Of course, there's been a LOT of time &amp; trial &amp; error. Statistically it makes sense. Dawkins has seen to that. Using his thoughts as a baseline for alien life is even more fascinating. I hope I live to see if his theories are born out.<br /><br />Of course, I recommend this highly. Definitely get this edition, if you can. If you've only read the first edition, get &amp; read this one. It's worth it.",5
"Reading this book was like meeting with a person about whom you have heard a lot, who has some kind of legendary status, and overall so well-acclaimed that you cannot resist the temptation to meet the person. <br /><br />Another thing you have heard is that the person is so simple, down to earth that he would take the trouble to talk to any layman, to make these biological terms easier, more comprehensible and comfortable to deal with. And you think talking to you won't cause him much trouble because you are well aware of some technical biological jargons. <br /><br />So, when Mr. Dawkins finally meets you through his legendary <i>The Selfish Gene</i>, you eagerly wait to hear a few more intricate complex terms - similar to the stature of the book and the writer. The chapters in the beginning (2 &amp; 3) bore a little bit with their roundabout words. But if you can keep a little bit patience up to Chapter 5, then as the chapters go on you begin to realize why this book is a <b>Classic</b> after all!<br /><br />I must agree that it's one of the finest books I have read. Chapter 1 is adorable with its nice philosophical leaps. The best chapters are <b>Battle of the Generations</b> and <b>Battle of the Sexes</b>. The chapter on memes sounds like the movie Inception. Overall the book is the best reward for its readers.",5
I do care... it's just a genetic thing.,5
"Although a lot has changed in social biology and ethology since this book was originally published in 1976, “The Selfish Gene” brought me numerous insights which made my respect for Dawkins grow immensely. I’ll explain why.<br /><br />The book can be considered today almost out of date, I think, and there’s much in it to be criticized. Dawkins language is particularly reductionist as he explains various types of animal behaviors mathematically while attributing them solely to genetic factors. <br /><br />He says, for instance, that an animal has 1/8 of chance of saving one of his cousins from drowning because there is a chance of 1 in 8 that he and his cousin have genes in common. Or that a mother cares about her babies just because their body is transporting half of her genes. <br /><br />I’m not questioning it because I found the theory insensitive or cruel (especially when it comes to human beings). We all know very well how important are genes determining behavior. But today we also know how deeply are another factors involved in this process. They are certainly relevant in different measures between animals and humans, but I’m inclined to believe that even in animals they do not exert this kind of dictatorship. And even if they did, it would be almost impossible to use mathematics to calculate things like the probability of an animal saving his cousin's life.<br /><br />In chapter 11 Dawkins introduces the notion of “memes” and makes an exception to the sovereignty of genes: he mentions briefly that culture may change what was genetically “predetermined” to happen and, surprisingly, that it can be considered another type of evolution. However, most of the book doesn’t take this possibility into account, which is one of the reasons why I find it out of date.<br /><br />Conversely, Dawkins brings up some really interesting ideas that had never come to my mind in other ways. One of them is mentioned in the second chapter, in which he explains the origins of replicant molecules (DNAs) and is confronted with the inevitable and very contemporary question: when does life begins? He solves the problem masterfully in my opinion: “Should we then call the original replicators ‘living’? Who cares? (…) Human suffering has been caused because too many of us cannot grasp that words are only tools for our use. The mere presence in the dictionary of a word like ‘living’ does not mean it necessarily has to refer to something definite in the real world”.<br /><br />Another of my favorite parts is the one where the talks about the evolution of the capability of simulation in animals. His theory is that conscience emerged because the simulation that brains do to calculate probabilities and risks associated to everyday tasks became so complex at one point of the evolution that it was inevitable to start including the “self” in it. <br /><br />I was also positively impressed by how Dawkins describes adaptation as the predominance of evolutionary stable strategies in opposition to unstable ones. It is an interesting approach to Darwin’s theory that he would probably have agreed with. The descriptions of various behaviors to exemplify his theory are also very engaging.<br /><br />Finally, the already mentioned chapter about memes is a good surprise at the end of the book, and reveals some of Dawkins’ skills as philosopher (as someone mentioned in a review below).<br /><br />For all these reasons, and although I was bored at many moments because of its reductionism, I found “The Selfish Gene” worth of reading. It certainly deserves its fame as a classic.<br />",3
"Writing lucidly about science for a lay audience while remaining scientifically rigorous is not easy, and Dawkins does a tremendous job as he examines evolution from the point of view of the gene rather than the organism. <br /><br />I found this book to contain a number of ""aha"" moments -- for example, that rather than pose the question ""Why is DNA an efficient mechanism for an individual organism to reproduce itself?"", we should ask instead ""How did a giant, complicated lumbering robot such as myself become a good mechanism for the reproduction of the self-replicating entities I call my genes? Why did biological matter floating around in the primordial stew originally clump together into larger organisms?"" <br /><br />Dawkins answers these questions and more in an engaging fashion, applying the theory of the selfish gene to aggression, altruism, sexual and familial relationships, and to the transmission of ideas in human societies. <br /><br />And he makes a point of leaving us with the optimistic thought that we as humans should be informed by our biological history, but need not be bound by it.",5
"Finally, and after an excessive period of time, the main cause of which was college overwhelming demands, I managed to read and finish, from cover to cover, the book that launched the fame of the most distinguished evolutionary biologist in the world (Richard Dawkins): The Selfish Gene.<br /><br />Dawkins is often characterized as the World's Most Outspoken Atheist. This may be true, but it's concerned with a relatively recent development in his character. I think such reduction is misleading and unfair, quite frankly. Dawkins is an intelligent evolutionary biologist and he has contributed a lot to the field over the past three or four decades. He is very passionate about Darwinian Evolution that I'm surprised that he's not been referred to as ""Darwin's pitbull"" as much as Sir Huxley was known as ""Darwin's Bulldog""!<br /><br />The book is an attempt by Dawkins to offer a meticulous explanation of organisms' behavior, especially animals. Animal behavior is such an intriguing subject, indeed!. Dawkins tries to explore this phenomenal world through the lens of what he calls, ""The Selfish Gene Theory"".<br /><br />The Selfish Gene Theory establishes that organisms evolve by Natural Selection, but the unit of selection is, surprisingly and against all common knowledge and conventions, the gene. It's not the species, as I used to firmly hold, not even the individual, but the gene, the selfish gene. Genes were here first long before us the multi-cellular organisms. In addition, they are ""the replicators"" who will live on, unlike us the mortals. They are the immortal units of selection, and we merely are ""survival machines"" as Dawkins affirms throughout the whole book. This, to me, has a very profound implication. It seems to me to negate the ""hypothesis"" of morality being also a product of our evolution because if the Selfish Gene Theory is true, then I don't see how the ""survival of the species"" would have mattered from the first place. However, Dawkins makes the case that selfish genes might ""program"" survival machines to adopt some forms of ""altruistic"" behaviors to meet their ""selfish"" ends.<br /><br />Dawkins' language is that of a ""reductionist"" which doesn't surprise me as a student of biology familiar with the scientific doctrine of ""Occam's Razor"". However, I understand how his language might disturb some readers. Dawkins reduces all forms of relationships and attributes them to ""genetic"" factors including those among family members. Altruistic behavior vs. selfish behavior can all be calculated mathematically. Your mother cares about you because you contain half of her genes! Forget love, affection, and all of that emotional talk. We're merely survival machines designed by our selfish genes to propagate them. Pretty disturbing, huh?<br /><br />Yet, this also has a crucial implication. Dawkins affirms in the beginning of the book that it's one of ""biology"", not ""ethics"". He states that we are ""selfish by nature"", but we can teach our children to be altruistic. To me, this raises a very important question: doesn't that assert that we, indeed, possess free will? This is a profound implication that I believe Dawkins was not aware of when first writing this book. He attempts to briefly discuss this matter in the endnotes by rejecting it, but I think he didn't succeed.There's some form of dualism that the theory suggests in our case: the conscious Homo sapiens.It's very evident and prevalent.<br /><br />One chapter of the book is devoted to what Dawkins call, ""memes"". It's such a great idea and it shows Dawkins' skill as a ""philosopher"". Simply, a meme is a ""replicating idea"" as Daniel Dennett defines it. It makes so much sense to me that memes are replicators just like genes floating from one mind to another and manipulating subjects to insure their survival. It seems to me that religion is an example of a meme that replicates itself (from followers to followers) and struggle for survival through consistent ""adaptation"" (modification)! Dawkins' animosity towards religion is probably as old as this book is, but he offers a very mild criticism of it which makes sense given that it's not really the center focus of this book.<br /><br />The Selfish Gene Theory is a revolutionary idea. However, even more revolutionary is the concept of ""The Extended Phenotype"" which illustrates the ""long reach of the gene"". Dawkins dedicates a whole book to this idea, and devotes the last chapter to it. The notion simply suggests that selfish genes influence very ""indirect"" behaviors such as, building nests in birds. I must read his book ""The Extended Phenotype"" since Dawkins explores the idea much more deeply and thoroughly.<br /><br />To conclude, the Selfish Gene Theory (or should I say hypothesis?) is indeed a profound seductive idea as an explanation of organisms' innate behavior. I don't know, though, how much of it is predicated upon scientific evidence and how much is mere speculation, but I do know that the book is a must-read for anyone interested in animal behavior. The book brilliantly offers answers to puzzling phenomenons, but it also raises a lot of profound questions.<br /><br />""The only kind of entity that has to exists in order for life to arise, anywhere in the universe, is the immortal replicator."" - R. Dawkins",4

  <i>“ There are more possible games of chess than there are atoms in the galaxy.”</i>
  <br />
</blockquote><br />Sometimes science books can become unintentionally funny:<br /><blockquote>
  <br />
  <i> “What is the good of sex? This is an extremely difficult question for the evolutionist to answer. Most serious attempts to answer it involve sophisticated mathematical reasoning.”</i>
  <br />
</blockquote><br /><br /><br />Okay!<br /><br />One of stupidest criticism here on Goodreads of Adam Smith’s Theory of Wealth of Nations’ was that he made the human selfishness as basis of his theory. It was stupid as Smith didn’t invented that ‘selfishness’ he merely showed us how our economy was already based on selfishness of individuals.<br /><br />It is same here. In fact, in this case ‘selfishness’ is apparent selfish behaviour of genes (‘apparent’ because genes do not make conscious choices, selfless-by-default ones just won’t survive) and any effects on the individuals are unconscious. Dawkins shows how selfishness of genes can actually bring out what, at first, may look like altruistic behaviour among animals. <br /><br />Also, we need not be slave to our genes. In fact, we <i>do</i> resist behaviour imposed on us by genes. The best examples are people who remain without children all their life, contraceptives, welfare state etc.<br /><blockquote>
  <br />
  <i>“Contraception is sometimes attacked as 'unnatural'. So it is, very unnatural. The trouble is, so is the welfare state. I think that most of us believe the welfare state is highly desirable. But you cannot have an unnatural welfare state, unless you also have unnatural birth- control, otherwise the end result will be misery even greater than that which obtains in nature.”</i>
  <br />
</blockquote><br />There are theories in here describing how first life must have started on planet. There is also a theory (theory, not law) that tries to explain why should people die of old age. Any explanations are better than 'God did it'. One of my favorite parts were those discussing Game theory involved in biology. <br /><br />Above all, there are all those fascinating aspects how some animals behave. There are some insects who can be like Chinese-boxes:<br /><blockquote>
  <br />
  <i> Female greenflies can bear live, fatherless, female offspring, each one containing all the genes of its mother. (Incidentally, an embryo in her mother's 'womb' may have an even smaller embryo inside her own womb. So a greenfly female may give birth to a daughter and a grand- daughter simultaneously, both of them being equivalent to her own identical twins.)</i>
  <br />
</blockquote><br />And...do you remember that romantic dialogue, 'I'll die for you'? Ladies among matinses take it too literally:<br /><blockquote>
  <br />
  <i>“Mantises … When they mate, the male cautiously creeps up on the female, mounts her, and copulates. If the female gets th e chance, she will eat him, beginning by biting his head off, either as the male is approaching, or immediately after he mounts, or after they separate.” </i>
  <br />
</blockquote><br />Isn’t that lovely? <br /><br />Than there are the friendly fights (mostly to get girls):<br /><blockquote>
  <br />
  <i> ""the notable thing about animal fights is that they are formal tournaments, played according to rules like those of boxing or fencing. Animals fight with gloved fists and blunted foils. Threat and bluff take the place of deadly earnest. Gestures of surrender are recognized by victors, who then refrain from dealing the killing blow or bite that our naive theory might predict.”</i>
  <br />
</blockquote><br />Dawkins also points out how most of Darwin’s oringal theory was wrong. Yet, you won’t find any Darwin-fundamentalists fighting against evolutionists. Several of Dawkins' own postulates must have been already proved wrong - it was written 40 years ago, that is like stone age to scientists. I don't think he would mind either.<br /><br />Creationists, well, they are a different breed. I guess given the condition the world is in, with all those stupid wars and ozone holes; any ideas of <i>intelligent</i> design can be easily trashed. And have you ever heard of that *stops to search for a word*thing called 'Donald Trump' - what is so intelligent about his existence? If I had my way, I would also have humanity consider whether we aren’t too liberal with the word when we call ourselves an 'intelligent' race. And even assuming there <i>was</i> a creator -than what about his/her aesthetic sense? Why should he give us bad body order? What is so intelligent about that?<br /><br />Coming back to creationists, well, I think Christian church was a little stupid (no offence) when it picked a head-on fight against evolutionists. All they needed to do was to manipulate the meaning of phrases in Bible and tell the world that evolution was embodied in Bible, it was just that they weren't interpreting it right. Hinduism and Islam are far cleverer in this regard. <br /><br />For example, as India’s respected prime minister will tell you Hindu gods had already invented <i>plastic</i> surgeries long before lesser mortals discovered Iron. Atom bombs, flying vehicles etc – you name it, we already had them ages ago. Read this <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1420032296"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">review</a> for more details. Whatever you may do, we did it in ancient times and were clever enough to forget about it.<br /><br />Also, one of most popular (pseudo) scholars on religion, Dr. Zakir Naik, tells us that truths like Big bang, evolution, Copernican solar system, existence of plasma state of matter, the growth of embryo etc. were all already explained by none other than God himself in Quran. There are many other scientific truths to be found in Quran that he has found using his <s>far-fetched</s> sophisticated reasoning, you can listen to him <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5h6CNhtVls"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">here</a>",4

"I asked Twitter for reading recommendations just before Christmas and one of them was this book. It's so outside my comfort zone (a book about genetics? Are you MAD?), I just went for it. And I am very glad I did.<br /><br />That's the great thing about Kindles. You can do mad stuff in seconds flat.<br /><br />Skip the forewords and introductions, they're sententious verbiage. Just start reading the book - by the time you've done, you'll actually WANT to go back to the forewords and revision notes. Because this book is seriously fun.<br /><br />Honestly. It's highly readable, thought-provoking and never less than entertaining. Imagine reading a TV series like Coast or a Robert Winston documentary - the mixture of powerful images, connections to the everyday and down to earth presentation actually make the subject matter of the book relevant, alive and, well, splendid.<br /><br />Richipoos takes the odd diversion to indulge in some academic spattery, (one reason, perhaps, this was dubbed a 'young book' - it was written 30 and more years ago) but generally is on the side of the reader, which is why his ideas come across so clearly. The book explores the role of the 'eternal gene', the miraculous and self-replicating bunch of amino-acids that is US and how we are effectively a co-operative of chemical conveniences. Starting with the primeval soup and ending with why mums and dads do what they do, it's a roller-coaster ride.

"Any reader of fiction understands the importance of narrative point of view. Influential evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins adopts that idea here. The point of view is that of the gene. His “selfish gene” is a metaphor, an anthropomorphic representation of a replicating sequence of genetic code.<br /><br />He clarifies this idea with an astonishing admission: <i> “There is no universally agreed definition of a gene.”</i>(p.36) Starting with this blank slate frees him to create parameters that suit his own purposes: <i> “A gene is defined as any portion of chromosomal material that potentially lasts for enough generations to serve as a unit of natural selection....[A] gene is a replicator with high copying fidelity.”</i> (p. 35) In one analogy he compares a gene to a cooperative team of rowers. The individual is merely a vehicle for the focused efforts of this team. Instead of quibbling about the physical entity of the gene, Dawkins focuses his attention on salient properties: copying errors, fecundity (the rate of replication), chromosomal rearrangement, and chemical “rivalry.” These in turn govern observable properties of the organism: viscosity (<i> “...any tendency for individuals to continue living to the place where they were born.”</i>) and memory (p.282)<br /><br />His arena is a multi-generational dynamic of ephemeral winners and losers, quantitative dominance in the gene pool. He proposes various strategies for achieving that dominance, and asserts that the results are mathematically predictable through game theory. A step-wise picture of evolution emerges: <i> “Progressive evolution may be not so much a steady upward climb as a series of discrete steps from stable plateau to stable plateau.”</i> (p.113) Each plateau signals the achievement of an <u>Evolutionary Stable Strategy</u> (ESS).<br /><br />This revolutionary book was published in 1976. Dawkins cites two important influences. William Donald Hamilton (1936-2000) developed the idea of “kin selection” – the basis for the principle that <i> “...a gene might be able to assist replicas of itself that are sitting in other bodies....”</i> (p.114) In a chapter titled “Genesmanship"", Dawkins provides a simplified version of a formula for calculating the odds that two individuals share a particular gene.<br /><br />George C. Williams (1926-2010) contributed the idea of pleioptropy – multiple effects of a single gene. An example is the activation of a gene when the chemical properties of aging accumulate. I mention these antecedents because I often felt I had fallen into a time warp. Dawkins' ideas are a far cry from the Mendelian genetics I learned in school. Readers familiar with these earlier evolutionary pioneers will have a much easier time navigating this book than I had. <br /><br />I read the 40th anniversary edition, published in 2016. Extensive explanatory footnotes, often running on for pages, have been added and need to be read in conjunction with the text. This is expedited by the formatting of the Kindle edition. <br /><br />Fortunately, this book is leavened with surprising behavioral examples. We learn that a whale song can continue for eight minutes without repetition. (p.68) We learn that a strain of worker bee has the “hygenic” behavior of detecting and culling grubs infected by a particular disease. The culling requires two steps: uncapping the wax cell of the larva and evicting the larva from the hive. (p.78) A strain of mice exhibit the “Bruce effect.” The male mouse exudes a chemical that causes a female impregnated by a different male to abort. (p.191) Vampire bats will regurgitate and share excess blood harvested during the night with unsuccessful bats. (p.298) Dawkins examines and explains these behaviors through the lens of his “selfish gene.”",4
"I read this book when I was a student and studying genetics at the time. This helped a lot, it made an awful lot more sense than what I was learning and I have Professor Dawkins to thank for making me look like a genius in a lecture and completely getting my head round an essay.<br /><br />I am a big fan of Richard Dawkins, and this is his genius. I admire his ability to argue something so comprehensively and convincingly. I first discovered him in a book of essays where he wrote a letter to his daughter Juliet (who was ten at the time) explaining how you must always look for evidence. That, I believe, is one of the most important things to learn in life and the way he presents it to a child is impressive.<br /><br />(The book, incidentally, is called How Things Work. I must see if I can add it)<br /><br />However, despite being in awe of Professor Dawkins, I find him a little cruel in the way he removes the potential for all the nice things in life. If he is correct, we may as well all be selfish and thoughtless at all times because to do otherwise is simply irrational. I like to retain a little naivete in my convictions, it makes life more palatable.<br /><br />Apparently ""The Blind Watchmaker"" is his best book, but I have completely read very few of his books and prefer to listen to him talk.",3
"I love reading books that challenge my worldview and compel me to change it. This book is an excellent work on Evolutionary biology, Genes, Behavioral biology and Natural selection, among many other fascinating topics. Dawkins is succinct, eloquent and a very intelligent tutor. He uses examples and metaphors to illustrate his point and to coalesce them all to form one unifying picture, of a universe, not in perfect harmony, but in tumult and constant change. The chapter on “Memes” blew me off absolutely; I would want my friends to read just that chapter even if they don’t read the whole book. His ideas are fascinating and logical, but his way of expressing and putting them in words is even better. What a shame that he got into the new atheist movement and all the bad publicity that came with it. As a scientist, I found him at the top of his game.<br /><br />This is a very readable, entertaining and beautifully written book that I would recommend to any one who, like me, bunked their biology lectures back in school. There is a lot to learn from this book. The 30th anniversary edition is annotated and made up to date with additional chapters, so the older edition should be avoided.<br /> Read it, let is rinse your brain, and repeat.<br />",5

"<br><i> The Doll </i> by Bolesław Prus is undeniably a great masterpiece of Polish realism in literature. This is an epic and detailed tale exploring XIX century Warsaw, tale in which Prus created a vivid picture of the city and people on the background of the economic, ideological and social transformations. <br><br>I’ve always loved reading about this nonexistent any more world. I mean that one recorded only on sepia-toned photographs. Men in the tailcoats, women in white gowns, multicultural society, Poles, Jews, Russians, merchants and aristocracy, lost professions … And all that and much more we can find here. From one side it is a story about a strong man who lifted up from the lower classes - literally- how significant is the scene of his exit from the basement, who having attained great wealth - only then considers himself to be worthy of woman from upper echelons. And who is the chosen one? Beautiful, with beauty of porcelain dolls, empty Isabella. <br><br>Wokulski, it's his name, is an incurable romantic. And in this case it’s rather euphemism for bloody damn fool, as ones say: the first sigh of love, the last sigh of reason.<br><br>Prus created a colorful and diverse gallery of minor characters : young scientist Ochocki dreaming about flying machines, old Wokulski’s friend Rzecki yearning for old times, Madame Krzeszowska, baroness from hell and her profligate husband, merry widow Kazia Wąsowska, naughty students sympathizing with socialism and many others. Novel explores their dreams, psychological troubles and involvements in historical events.<br><br>But this is also a story about Warsaw itself, the city of great contrasts, city of poor and rich realistically showed through its streets, parks, shops, buildings and churches. Warsaw, in fact, is one of the characters of the book. With his novel Prus paid a homage to the city and like Lisbon you may visit with Pessoa, Petersburg with Dostoevsky or London with Dickens so Prus became a great chronicler of old Warsaw. <br><br><br><img src=""https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1396010115i/9075804._SX540_.jpg"" class=""gr-hostedUserImg"" loading=""lazy"">",5
"You've probably never heard of this book, but it comes damn close to meeting War and Peace on its own terms.<br /><br />History rolls forward. The aristocratic scumbags are replaced by capitalist scumbags. The solutions to yesterday's problems become new problems and we don't get anywhere. A great man becomes a great man in pursuit of a vain and hopeless goal that eventually destroys him. A world of fops, fools, scoundrels, and nihilists loses something it desperately needs.<br /><br />We can be 99% certain that society is irredeemably fucked. But unless we try to be better, we deprive ourselves of that last 1%.<br /><br />When you hold out hope for human potential, you'll almost definitely be disappointed. But damn it, we've got to hope. And we've got to try.",5

"Reading this classic, I could not help thinking that it would be greatly enjoyed by the lovers of Dickens. It is similar in quite a few ways - wide cast of characters on the canvas of a broader historical, social and geographical background. It has also been initially published by instalments in a newspaper. However, when Dickens is sentimental Prus is satirical or at least humorous. It was interesting and entertaining read. But for me it lacked psychological depth I expected.<br /><br />The main conflict is the unrequited love of a merchant, Wokulski, who becomes rich through successful deals and the ownership of a haberdashery shop in Warsaw. He is absolutely smitten by an aristocratic maiden who does not treat him as an equal. I found very hard to believe in all this passion and his blindness in the matters of love while he is very shroud and successful in other ways. The book occasionally reminded chivalry novels from the 17th century placed into the context of the 19th. Also for me it was evident that Prus was not sure how all of this would end when he has started to publish it. <br /><br />Inevitably, I think the comparison with the <a href=""https://goodreads.com/book/show/87346.The_Cherry_Orchard"" title=""The Cherry Orchard by Anton Chekhov"" rel=""noopener"">The Cherry Orchard</a> comes to mind, the play, where a successful representative of a new capitalism, Lopakhin is buying an estate from the aristocracy whose time is over. It is a similar conflict here as well. Even plot wise, Wokulski is overpaying for the house when buying it from the father of his Dame. But Chekhov manages to create an atmosphere of transience around it, melancholic and sometimes tragic. While Lopakhin seems to be a real person bringing new energy, it is difficult to ascertain any power or even meaning in Wokuski’s character apart from the overwhelming servitude to his Dame and the passion that is hard to believe. The aristocracy here is greedy, useless and pathetic in a sort of one-dimensional way. It might have been the case of course or maybe Prus is satirising. But it lacked the depth of a more successful realistic piece of the period.<br /><br />However, the novel might have been considered innovative even now. Prus experiments with the narrative style. The chapters traditionally told are intervened with the diary of Zetsky, the old and very loyal Wokulski’s shop manager. Those sections told from the perspective of a pleasantly unreliable narrator is sheer delight to read. <br /><br />The novel still holds a lot of entertainment value. There were the moments when I was properly laughing. It is also a very valuable historical document of that period; how the matters stood in Eastern Europe, in particular in Poland that was divided into tree areas of influence by other powers at that time. This feeling of despair and sometimes misplaced patriotism that cannot find the proper way out penetrates the novel.<br /><br />Another thing one cannot help but notice is how casual antisemitism was in those places and times. It is shocking by out standards. And I felt in the tone of the story that the author is not sure himself where he stood. The most “enlightened” view presented by Wokulski is that Polish society made the Jews who they were - greedy and predatory by systematically killing the best of them through the century, so only the worst adopted.<br /><br />And women… I would be surprised if this period piece would represent the sensitivities of our times. But it is not misogyny of “Anna Karenina”, it is more of a <a href=""https://goodreads.com/book/show/141077.The_Kreutzer_Sonata"" title=""The Kreutzer Sonata by Leo Tolstoy"" rel=""noopener"">The Kreutzer Sonata</a>’s kind and better. <br /><br />This is a monologue by the character of a “strong” woman:<br /><br /><i>‘You are all wretches. When a woman, at a certain stage in her life, dreams of an ideal love, you mock her illusions and demand a flirtation, without which a girl is boring, and a married woman stupid. Not until she — thanks to your collective efforts — allows banal proposals to be made, glances at you fondly, presses your hand — only then does some medieval moralist in a cowl emerge from a dark corner and solemnly curse her, created though she is in the form and likeness of a daughter of Eve: “You are not allowed to love, you will never be truly loved, because you had the misfortune to be put up for market, and because you have no illusions left!” Yet who stole her illusions, if not you and your brothers? What sort of world is this, in which illusions are first stripped off and the naked body then sentenced to death?’</i><br /><br />This view that the society of men converts the innocent girls into “whores” who after that are blamed for everything is very close to the view by the main character of "" The Kreutzer sonata"" who murdered his wife for suspected infidelity. On the one hand, it seems to be progressive, to some extent. But it totally deprives a woman fo any agency or responsibility for that matter. I was surprised to meet this attitude here. I thought it was more related to Tostoy’s later philosophy, but apparently it was zeitgeist.<br /><br />And this is more of the usual one coming from the mouth of our wounded romantic hero: <br /><br /><i>“Wokulski laughed aloud: ‘It’s possible to free a woman from intriguers, but is it possible to free her from her own instincts? What would you advise if the man whom you consider a trifler or intriguer is to her a male of the same species as herself?’ Gradually a feeling of rage began dominating him. He walked about the room, and said: ‘How can one struggle against a law of nature by which a bitch, even of the best breed, will couple — not with a lion — but with a dog? Show her a whole menagerie of the noblest animals, but she’ll renounce them all for a few dogs. Yet it is hardly surprising, for they are her species.’”</i><br /><br />Nevertheless, it is a very well written and translated novel, and sometimes I’ve met with the proper jewels in the text:<br /><br /><i>“The world is like an amateur theatre, where it is not done to insist on leading parts but reject minor roles. In any case, all roles are good, providing they are well played and not taken too seriously.’</i><br />",3
"A book well known and loved in Poland but less well known abroad. This is a shame as I’d have no hesitation in putting it in the same league as Tolstoy - and like Tolstoy this is a huge book, almost 700 pages long. It is helped by a very good translation. <br /><br />At one level a love story and the power of love to distort someone life, but it is also a story of the relationships between classes - especially between the aristocracy and the self-made man, and it can be read as an existential exploration of the meaning of life. On top of this it is an insightful historical drama of Poland under Russian rule in the late 19th century. Finally it is prescient - talking of flying machines, the fall of the aristocracy and future problems for Jews in Europe. <br /><br />So you can see I am a fan. To enjoy it you have to be prepared for 19th century writing - it can’t be accused of ever being spartan writing! Also I found one of voices less convincing than the others. Nevertheless a great novel.",5
"In writing this majestic novel about fin de siècle 19th century Warsaw, Prus illustrated all the social currents that would make Poland such a cauldron of differing identities in the following century. Ostensibly a story about the excruciating infatuation of a successful merchant, Wokulski, for a noble's daughter, the book is also about three generations of men coming to terms with Poland's past and present and trying to break away from the Nobles' Republic in order to create a modern future for the nation. Although Prus could, naturally, have had no idea of what would happen to his country in the next century, the battle lines of ethno-nationalism, later exploited by the National Democrat anti-Semites, the Catholic Church, the Nazis and the Communists begin to emerge.

"""The Doll"" is as a landmark work of Polish literature that will be of tremendous interest to anyone of Polish descent or having friends who received their education in Poland. It examines all of the major political, cultural and social issues that were debated in Poland in the second half of the nineteenth century. Because The Doll"" is taught in Polish secondary schools, the Anglophone reader is assured the pleasure of being able to discuss the work with any of his or her friends in the expatriate Polish community. This is a major benefit for a work that poses significant challenges for the Anglophone reader.<br />To properly comprehend ""The Doll"" one needs a very solid understanding of Polish history, class structure and society in the 19th century. At the same time, the reader needs some experience in reading and decoding works written under censorship in which the author, poet or librettist discusses a political issue using events in other countries as proxies for those in the country that he or she is truly interested in.<br />The key issue is that the events take place in Poland during the 19th century when Poland was partitioned between Russia, Austria and Germany. The hero Stanisław Wokulski has participated in the January Uprising (1863-1864) against Russia and spent a number of years in Siberian exile which indicates that the Polish national question is a major background issue. However, the subject of Polish independence is never directly mentioned.<br />Poles of the Jean Paul II/Solidarity generation view Wokulski as a figure like Julien Sorel from the Red and the Black who makes the perverse decision to become a priest because under the Bourbon Restoration because no other options were available to him. From this perspective Wokulski who has the innate qualities of political leader has no outlet for his natural talents in the Russian occupied Polish Partition. As a consequence he devotes himself entirely to his love for a woman who is inaccessible because she is an aristocrat whereas Wokulski is ""works in trade"" (i.e. is a retailer).<br />In the eyes of Prus, Wokulski's infatuation is a massive folly in the style of the great Polish romantic poet Adam Mickiewicz. The woman he is obsessed with is both shallow and nasty. Wokulski's loyalist friend Igacy Rzecki is appalled. He wants Wokulski to marry a sensible woman of his own social class and dedicate himself to Polish independence which is referred to by the proxy term ""Bonapartism"" in order to get past the censor. Rzecki's idea makes no sense either. Wokulski is not living in democracy and because of his revolutionary past would have been too closely monitored by the Tsarist police to participate in any underground organization.<br />Wokulski however is lucid about his situation. He is aware that the best course for him is to concentrate on his business and thus create wealth in Poland. Unfortunately his instincts pull him in the other direction. He is unable to stop loving his fantasy woman. In order to make himself acceptable in her aristocratic milieu he sells his businesses so as to passively live off his investments. When, Wokulski finally sees through the woman that he loves, life loses all meaning for him. His morale collapses and he dies shortly afterwards.<br />""The Doll"" contains a lengthy discussion on Poland's Jews. Being a logical positivist, Prus felt that the differences between Jews and Christians were entirely artificial. What Prus desired was for Polish Jews and Catholics to merge into a single progressive community of atheists. Accordingly, he presents the Jews in a very favorable light. Wokulski has many good Jewish friends. Moreover Wokulski vigorously argues that through their business activities which create wealth, the Jews are making an important contribution to Polish society.<br />Prus' sharpest criticisms are for the Polish aristocrats who do nothing to create wealth but simply spend money ostentatiously and amass debts while regarding everyone else with contempt particularly Jews and tradesmen (i.e. retailers.)<br />Prus provides a very insightful portrait of Poland under Russian rule in the second half of the nineteenth century. ""The Doll"" is in no ways prophetic. Today we know that Poland was finally liberated by ""Solidarity"" which was in its essence a coalition of the Roman Catholic clergy and blue collar unions. In ""The Doll"", Prus discounts the Catholic Church as an utterly inconsequential force in Polish society. There is no mention that I can recall either of unions or any working class organizations. ""The Doll"" is a logical positivist work which assumes that leadership for change in the modern world can only come from the educated middle classes. It is a great novel for any reader willing to forgive it this one blind spot.",5

</a><br><br>I need to <b>parse my rating</b> of this book into the <b>good</b> (or great), the <b>bad</b> and the very <b> fugly</b> because I thought aspects of it were <b>inspired genius</b> and parts of it were <b>dreggy</b>, boring and living near the border of <b>awful</b>. In the end, the wowness and importance of the novel's ideas as well as the segments that I thoroughly enjoyed carried the book to a strong 3.5 star rating.<br><br><b>THE REALLY GOOD/EXCELLENT</b> - I loved the first third of the book in which the basic outline of the ""Brave New World"" and its devalued, conveyer belt morality is set forth. The narrative device employed by Huxley of having the Director of <i>Hatchery and Conditioning</i> provide a walking tour to students around the facility as a way to knowledge up the reader on the societal basics was perfect. We learn of the cloning/birthing process, the caste system and the fundamental tenets upon which the society is organized.<br><a href=""http://s153.photobucket.com/albums/s207/sullypython/Decorated%20images/?action=view&amp;current=cronebabies2.jpg"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">

</a><br><br>This was as good a use of infodumping exposition as I had come across in some time and I was impressed both with the content and delivery method. The reader gets a crash course in world and its history in a way that fit nicely into the flow of the narrative without ever feeling forced. This was easily the best part of the novel for me, and Huxley's mass production-based society of enforced hedonism and anti-emotion was very compelling. Sort of like...<br> <a href=""http://s153.photobucket.com/albums/s207/sullypython/Decorated%20images/?action=view&amp;current=Mr_Spock-1v2.jpg"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">

</a><br><br>Now, long jumping to the end of the novel...<br><br>I also thought the final ""debate"" near the story's climax between John (the ""savage"") and Mustapha Mond, the World Controller, was exceptional.

</a><br>The only purpose of this long, long.....LONG section seems to be to allow the reader to see Bernard Marx do a complete 180 in his views on the society once he finds himself in the role of celebrity by virtue of his relationship with John the savage. Sorry, this just did not strike me as a big enough payoff for this dry, plodding section. It was a test of endurance to get through this portion of the book, so I'm being generous when I give it a weak 2.0 to 2.5 stars.

</a><br><br>Bottom-line, I think this is a book that should be read. It's important book and there is much brilliance here. Plus, it is short enough that the stale boring segments aren't too tortuous to get through.

"<i>Warning! The following review contains humor. If you read it and actually think that I'm being critical of Huxley, try reading it again. (Here's a hint. Look for the irony of the italicized parts when compared to the previous statements.) If you post a comment that asserts that I'm wrong/ stupid/ crazy for this and/or try to lecture me on all the points you think I missed then I'm going to assume that you read it literally, missed the joke, didn't read the other comments where I've already answered this about a dozen times, and I will delete your post.</i> <br /><br />I have to apologize for this review. The concept of this book was so outlandish that I think it made my mind wander, and you may find some odd random thoughts scattered in it. <br /><br />Anyhow, this book was so silly and unrealistic. Like any of this could happen. In the far future the babies are genetically engineered and designed for certain stations in life with a large workforce bred to be happy with menial jobs that don’t stress them physically or mentally. <i>I really should look into getting that data entry position I saw in the job postings. It’d be a lot less stressful than what I‘m doing now.</i> <br /><br />In addition to all the genetic modifications, the children are raised by the state, and words like ’father’ and ’mother’ are considered obscenities. Subliminal messaging through infancy and childhood also condition people to repeat idiotic platitudes as if they are genuine wisdom. <i>I’ve been in a bad mood today. I need to turn that frown upside down.</i> And since the world economy depends on constant consumption by the highest classes, they’re encouraged to be wasteful <i>The collars on a couple of my shirts are a little frayed. I should go buy some new ones and throw the old ones out.</i> and to engage in activities that demand spending and resource use. <i>Should I get a new set of golf clubs? I lost my old ones when we moved, but I hadn’t played in a long time. But would I play more if I got new clubs? There‘s that really nice looking course right down the street. I don‘t know how they keep the grass that green in this heat.</i> The population even gets to zip around in their own private helicopters rather than cars. <i>Man, when are they going to come out with jet packs for everyone. It’s 2011 and I’m still driving around in a car like a chump. I want my jet pack!</i><br /><br />Casual sex is actively encouraged. <i>Wow. These condom commercials on TV have gotten really racy.</i> The population is also programmed to be constantly partaking of some form of entertainment and to never just sit quietly and think <i>I’m bored. Writing is boring.</i> or to be alone <i>Let’s check Facebook and see what all my friends are doing.</i><br /><br />One of the sillier ideas is that the foundation of this society is Henry Ford’s assembly lines and that Ford has become the most revered figure in history. Like a businessman could ever become that popular. <i>Is Steve Jobs making any announcements this week? I get itchy when there‘s no new Apple products.</i> <br /><br />While everyone seeks to be constantly entertained, all of the entertainment panders to the lowest common denominator. <i>Hey, Jersey Shore is on!</i> and the emphasis is on presenting it with gimmicks to engage the audience like ’the feelies’, movies that the audience can also smell and feel the sensation from. <i>I wonder if they’ll re-release Avatar at the movies so I can see it in 3D again like James Cameron intended?</i> At one point, a character complains about the feelies, “But they’re told by an idiot….works of art out of practically nothing but pure sensation.” <i>I should go see that new Michael Bay Transformers movie.</i><br /><br />Perhaps the most far fetched idea in this is that the population has been trained to sedate themselves with a drug called soma that relives any potential anxieties and keeps people from thinking about anything upsetting. <i>I want a beer</i>.<br /><br />I guess this Huxley guy might have gotten lucky and predicted a few things, but he was way off base about where society was going. <br />",4

  </i>
</b><br><br>These are words uttered in the face of tyranny and complete oppression, though they are very rare words to be spoken or even thought of in this world because every human passion and sense of creativity is repressed and eradicated through a long and complex process of conditioning.<br><br>And that’s what makes this novel so powerful; it’s not unbelievable. Like Orwell’s <i>1984</i> and Atwood’s <i>The Handmaid’s Tale, </i> there’s just enough truth within <i>Brave New World</i> for it to be real. It’s a cruel mirroring of our own existence, should we follow a certain path too strongly. And that's the wonder of speculative fiction, though unlike the other two books, there’s no violence involved in Huxley’s world. It’s just as controlling and scary, but it’s done in a more indirect way. <br><br><b>Sex is on tap, everybody <i>should</i> be happy.</b><br><br>People don’t go missing in the night nor are they stoned to death by a group of their peers, but they have just as little freedom (even if they don’t realise it.) In this dystopia they are trained from birth to think and feel in a certain way, and, for whatever reason, should they ever deviate from their ordained path, they are fed drugs that induce happiness and serenity; thus, the populace is kept within their desired space, and persist with the tasks they were born to do. Very few of them even consider that this is wrong; this is all they have known. And to make things even more maniacally clever, all physical and sexual needs are fulfilled completely as everybody belongs to everybody else in every sense with the ultimate goal of people never developing desire. All desire should be fulfilled, nobody wants for anything else. <br><br>People are machines and houses are factories. They are mass produced and designed to be one thing and one thing only. All values are inverted. The idea of showing any emotion is horrific and repulsive. Love is unknown and alien. Death is associated with sweetness and relief. Children are fed candy when they are thought about death, so they associate the two together, so when as adults they see death they think of treats rather than the loss of someone they have known and worked beside for years. <br><br><b>In <i>Brave New World</i> people are husks, empty and detached, without ever realising it.</b><br><br><img src=""https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1540394280i/26494132._SY540_.jpg"" width=""400"" height=""500"" alt=""description"" class=""gr-hostedUserImg"" loading=""lazy""><br>-John, the savage, as he enters the new world<br><br>I can only admire and praise Huxley’s genius through the writing. Like all effective dystopian societies, reading and information plays an exceedingly important role. As with Ray Bradbury's<i>Fahrenheit 451</i>, all books have been destroyed and made inaccessible. John, one of the few characters who was born away from the new world, stumbles across a volume of Shakespeare and it changes his life. He can only think and feel in Shakespearean language and begins to view the world through a semi-romantic lens and only finds depravity when he walks into the new world. <br><br>It’s everything he hates. He has been termed the savage, though he knows and understands the real meaning of the term even if those who call him such do not. Naturally, he becomes depressed and isolated in this new space, a space that he cannot be a part of or accepted in (not that he would want to be.) And I found him by far the most interesting and compelling character within the story because he is the only one to really look beyond the boundaries of his own experience and to find it wanting. <br><br>So this is a terribly important novel and I can’t believe I have only just read it. If you haven’t read it already, you know what you have to do. This isn’t something to be missed. It’s a novel that made me think and imagine in a way a book hasn’t done in quite some time.<br><br>___________________________________<br><br>You can connect with me on social media via <a href=""https://linktr.ee/sean.ultra_vegan1"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">My Linktree</a>.<br>__________________________________",5
"Aldous Huxley wrote <i>Brave New World</i> in 1932. That's almost eighty years ago, but the book reads like it could have been written yesterday. (especially interesting to me was how Huxley was able to predict the future of both genetic engineering <i>and</i> the action blockbuster. <i>Damn</i>.)<br /><br />I think I liked this one better than <i>1984</i>, the book traditionally considered to be this one's counterpart. Not really sure why this is, but it's probably because this one has a clearer outsider character (the Savage) who can view the world Huxley created through his separate perspective. <br /><br />In this light, I will give the last word to Neil Postman, who discussed the differences between Orwell and Huxley's views of the future: <br /><br />""What Orwell feared were those who would ban books. What Huxley feared was that there would be no reason to ban a book, for there would be no one who wanted to read one. <br />Orwell feared those who would deprive us information. Huxley feared those who would give us so much that we would be reduced to passivity and egoism. Orwell feared that the truth would be concealed from us. Huxley feared the truth would be drowned in a sea of irrelevance. Orwell feared we would become a captive culture. Huxley feared we would become a trivial culture, preoccupied with some equivalent of the feelies, the orgy porgy, and the centrifugal bumblepuppy. <br />As Huxley remarked in 'Brave New World revisited,' the civil libertarians and rationalists who are ever on the alert to oppose tyranny 'failed to take into account man's almost infinite appetite for distractions.' <br />In 'Nineteen Eighty-Four' people are controlled by inflicting pain. In 'Brave New World' people are controlled by inflicting pleasure. <br />In short, Orwell feared that what we hate will ruin us. Huxley feared that what we love will ruin us."" ",5
"Wow, the <i>anger</i> over this rating! My first post for this book was a quote and a gif of Dean from <i>Supernatural</i> rolling his eyes and passing out. And people were <b>pissed</b>.

So I will: This is still one of the most boring emotionless books I have ever read. It seemed like a natural choice after I loved Orwell and Atwood but, my god, Huxley is a dry, dull writer. <br /><br />Another reviewer called this book a ""sleeping pill"" and that is a fantastic description.

"remember that last semester of english class, senior year, where every class seemed painfully long and excrutiatingly pointless? when everybody sat around secretly thinking of cute and witty things to put in other people's yearbooks? when the teachers realized we were already braindead from filling out three dozen student loan applications and college housing forms? that's when honors english started getting a little lazy. <br /><br />not that i minded. everybody got a book list. then everybody got split up into groups. you were responsible for reading all the books on your own, but one in particular was chosen for your group to present at the end of the semester. you know--- as a refresher for the rest of the class. because of course EVERYONE was gonna read EVERY book.<br /><br />i can't remember what i did instead of reading ""brave new world"", but it was probably fun and involved copious amounts of sweet tea and a gigantic paper mache cow. fortunately it didn't matter because the only group to take their presentation seriously was the ""brave new world"" group, and the way they presented stuck with me long enough to compel me to read the book later.<br /><br />maybe it was the weird music they had playing during their presentation, maybe it was the fact that super hot chris mayns had to sit in my group (the alphas) but i was seriously attracted to the world this group created in our classroom. we drew cards randomly to determine our class, then sat accordingly and wore cute little colored wristbands. everybody got pez (soma!) and *gasp* a birth control belt. throughout the presentation people were moved next to someone and lost a packet on their belt (listen, this is scandalous for a bible belt high school, ok? by the way, i did NOT get to sit next to chris, which is probably good because i would have been mortified and choked on a pez) <br /><br />anyway, the presentation was fun, but i didn't get around to reading my (now ex) boyfriends copy until a year ago. and i started getting a small, evil thought exactly the same as i had in class so many years ago... maybe some people would actually like this system. maybe some people would actually BENEFIT from this system. people don't have to think? they aren't expected to do much, go to college, become something bigger than what they actually are? they're rewarded with good feeling drugs? they are proud to have accomplished what they have? and they... DON'T HAVE TO THINK FOR THEMSELVES!?<br /><br />I know i'm going to get slammed for saying this later, especially because i never do actual reviews or completely delve into what i'm thinking (so shoot me) but haven't you ever been roaming the world wide inter-web and found a little troller you thought ""well, this person is a poor use of a human brain?"" yes, you have. admit it.<br /><br />just think, a little test tube tweaking and that person wouldn't mind manning the cash register at piggly wiggly for the rest of his life, saving the rest of humanity from noxious online rants about the hotness of avril lavinge and the brilliance of starcraft (apparently its a video game thats KOOLER THAN U!!!!1#)<br /><br />you're tempted, i can tell...<br /><br />",0
"This book presents a futuristic dystopia of an unusual kind. Unlike in Orwell's 1984, Huxley's dystopia is one in which everyone is happy. However, they are happy in only the most trivial sense: they lead lives of simple pleasures, but lives without science, art, philosophy or religion. In short, lives without deeper meaning. Although people are expected to work hard and efficiently during working hours, during off hours people live in an infantile way, never engaging their minds, and satisfying themselves with sex and drugs.<br /><br />The premise of the book I find quite interesting. However, the execution is lacking. The characters are not particularly endearing, and indeed they are quite flat. Worse, Huxley fails to explain why this future of controlled contentment is wrong. The reader will intuit that the this indeed a dystopia posing as a utopia, but Huxley's reliance on this feeling is a philosophical failure. It is the burden of the author to present us not with an account of something we know is bad, but to explain the source of the knowledge.<br /><br />Huxley attempts something akin to an explanation in the second-to-last chapter, a discussion between ""the Savage"" who grew up outside civilization and Mustalpha Mond, a World Controller. However, the attempt falls short, as Mond has concise answers to all of the Savage's questions, and the Savage lacks the education and/or intellectual power to find reason behind his feelings.<br /><br />During the conversation, Mond refers to philosopher Francis Bradley and credits him with the idea that philosophy is ""the finding of bad reason for what one believes by instinct."" Perhaps this inclusion is intended to convey that Huxley agrees and will make no attempt to manufacture a ""bad reason"" why the world he created is evil. However, I find this deeply unsatisfying. Why write a book to tell people what they already know? Moreover, a single reference to Bradley is not sufficient to convince me that this definition of philosophy is correct. If Huxley's novel relies heavily on this idea, he should have supported it with more than a solitary statement of Mond. Indeed, Mond promptly refutes the statement by denying instinct as separate from conditioning, and as the civilized population of the world seems to be controlled largely by conditioning, it would seem that in Huxley's world, Mond is correct!<br /><br />In summary, Huxley crafts an interesting future world where people are blithely content without knowing passion or pain. Unfortunately, he fails both to craft an interesting story to set in this world and to write a strong philosophical argument why such a world would be harmful for mankind. He relies on the obvious faults of the world and the intuitive reaction of the reader, and thus provides no deeper insights.<br /><br />As a social message, as a novel, and as a statement on the way in which mankind should behave, I find Brave New World inferior in almost every way to 1984. The one word of praise I will give to Huxley's novel is that his dystopia is more unusual and more intriguing than Orwell's. If only he had dome something more with it.",2
"I first read <i>Brave New World</i> many years (decades) ago in high school, and I remember thinking it was really interesting at the time. Well, I must have been a doofus back then because this reread just didn't live up to expectations. To be honest, my impression now is that it's all a bit of a mess.<br /><br />First, who exactly are the main characters here? We start following a few people, but end up focusing on someone else entirely. None of the characters are particularly sympathetic, not even the supposedly enlightened ""savage"" man from outside this world. And this savage man, even though he had a bit of homeschooling in the middle of nowhere, can converse on a superior level with the Controller of Western Europe upon meeting him. (Cue eye-rolling.)<br /><br />The story relies heavily on Shakespeare quotes to make its point, often devolving into random ramblings for pages at a time. In a whole chapter devoted to discussions on religion, it clearly implies that turning one's back on religion causes a society to melt down into dystopia. (More eye-rolling.)<br /><br />And on top of that, the part that annoys me the most is its treatment of the female main character. The ""savage"" calls her a whore every time he feels attracted to her and goes so far as to physically attack her, since it's obviously her fault for tempting him. I know this was written in the 1930s, so maybe this sort of rape-culture thinking was the norm back then, but it doesn't make reading it now any less offensive.<br /><br />I'll be generous and give it 3 stars for being a classic with some interesting ideas about dystopian society. But if I were to rank it against books out there today, it's not worth more than 2 stars. Womp womp.",3
"This set the stage about what a dystopian story should be or not be. <br><br>“But I don't want comfort. I want God, I want poetry, I want real danger, I want freedom, I want goodness. I want sin.”<br><br>First published in 1932, this is timeless and is as relevant today as when it was first written. Sixteen years before Orwell's <a href=""https://goodreads.com/book/show/5470.1984"" title=""1984 by George Orwell"" rel=""noopener"">1984</a> but eleven years after <a href=""https://goodreads.com/book/show/76171.We"" title=""We by Yevgeny Zamyatin"" rel=""noopener"">We</a> by <a href=""https://goodreads.com/author/show/43298.Yevgeny_Zamyatin"" title=""Yevgeny Zamyatin"" rel=""noopener"">Yevgeny Zamyatin</a>, this is a high water mark for the genre, many of its themes could be told today. Truth be said, this could be published today and would be just as good, it rises to the challenge and then towers above it.<br><br>“If one's different, one's bound to be lonely.”<br><br>Everyday life makes me think of this book all the time. Huxley does more than describe a bleak and cynical post-apocalyptic or dystopian world, he looks a dystopian resident in the eye and puts before him a mirror to flesh out what is real and unreal. Further, Huxley has turned that same mirror on the reader and we see in his far future fantasy a reality that could be today. Huxley reveals that the seeds of Mustafa Mond and his ilk have fertile ground in our culture and in our souls.<br><br>“No social stability without individual stability.”<br><br>Finally, Huxely provides a glimpse behind the curtain, we see the false wizard in his machinations. The world that has been crafted for the denizens of Huxley's nightmare landscape is explained fully and matter-of-factly by Mond. Huxley's sermon is delivered as stoically and deterministically as Jonathon Edwards ""Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God"".<br><br>""You all remember, I suppose, that beautiful and inspired saying of Our Ford's: History is bunk.""<br><br>A must read.<br><br>*** 2020 Re-read:<br><br>Reading this brilliant work after a few years only just reminded me of not only what an exceptional book it is, but of also how important it is in literature.<br><br>“In 1999, the Modern Library ranked Brave New World as #5 on its list of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century. In 2003, Robert McCrum, writing for The Observer, included Brave New World chronologically at #53 in ""the top 100 greatest novels of all time"", and the novel was listed at #87 on The Big Read survey by the BBC.”<br>-	Wikipedia<br><br>Huxley was greatly affected and influenced by economic events in the England of the 1920s and of the need for stability, but at what cost? A trip to America and an exploration of Henry Ford’s autobiography My Life and Work further led him towards the centralized and industrialized world that he created in BNW.<br><br>Huxley, perhaps more so than Orwell, has crafted a domain wherein the individual has succumbed to the will of the state. But Huxley’s vision is more subtle and therefore more insidious – the citizens of Huxley’s dystopia are brainwashed and seem genuinely happy. The dehumanizing automation of births and families as well as the somnambulist / hypnotic effects of Soma further create a scenario where out traditional attitudes of right and wring have been displaced.<br><br>Most of all in this reading is the characterization of John and of his juxtaposition with him as a product of the savage reservation and of his alienation in the London of the brave new world. In John, Huxley has created a shadow of Miranda from The Tempest, and the civilization he finds is one that he ultimately rejects in favor of the most extreme form of individual choice.<br><br>Timeless and important. <br><br><img src=""https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1580425803i/28875910.jpg"" width=""300"" height=""400"" alt=""description"" class=""gr-hostedUserImg"" loading=""lazy"">",5
"I finally managed to finish the dystopian classics triangle - 1984, Fahrenheit 451 and Brave new World. For me the winner is Brave New World. Although I find the world imagined is less realistic than the other two it is equally tragic. <br /><br />I finally got that somewhat lost feeling of total happiness when reading a book, that tingle in the pleasure receptors when you find a great book. Even though I recently read many books that I loved I seem to have lost that feeling of satisfaction when being face to face with an IT book. I thought the reason was that I started to read more, a lot more. Before Goodreads I used to read 10-15 book/year max so I had more time to enjoy a book, to get lost in it. Although I was happy that I read more and that I managed to finish books that I wanted to read for a long time the intensity of the feelings that reading stir in me had diminished. I am so elated that I can still get immersed in a book with all my being. I am so happy that I realized the problem is not how many books I read but what I read and the relationship I build with that book/author. I’ll keep reading when/what/how much I want to knowing that from time to time (probably once-twice/year) I will find that book that will make me remember why I read. <br /><br />When I started BNW I thought that it was going to be another one of those books that you know they are a work of art an appreciate them but in the same time are not very pleasant to read. Something like the Hunger by Hamsun or The Stranger by Camus. The beginning was really uncomfortable, especially the descriptions of the embryos and the erotic child games. Brrr. My hair stood up reading that. However, I quickly got absorbed and loved every second spent reading.",5
"Brave New World says as much about Aldous Huxley as it does about our modern world. <br /><br />Maybe more.<br />***<br /><br />When he wrote it, Huxley was in the process of losing his inner child. Darling of the Jet Set, he was the literary version of their current idol, Cole Porter. <br /><br />And in the end, the sophisticated public’s jaundiced taste for quick, fun and outré reads made him disposable - to us all.<br /><br />And worst of all, to his own deep, dreaming subconscious!<br /><br />Shy, lanky, shortsighted polymath Huxley was born to a family of Eminent Victorians, and was given ample leisure time to read any book he could get his hands on - which was them all. <br /><br />They would call him a nerd nowadays. <br /><br />But his reading and shyness disassociated him from the rough-and-tumble world. He had no fixed anchor. <br /><br />Like so many of us, he had lost his centre of gravity, or had never had one.<br /><br />But entre-deux-guerres Europe loved him, and adopted him as one of its own. The darling of the Smart Young Things - as the Catholic Waugh tartly put it - he was witty, caustic and irreverent. <br /><br />He could do no wrong - except in the eyes of social activists, on one side, and believers on the other.<br /><br />So it was at the midpoint of his career that he took up his pen against the future in Brave New World. If he couldn’t be serious, he could nevertheless shock.<br /><br />Problem is, he half-loved his own Utopia. And in later life he moved to the U.S.A. and became an early advocate of the Southern California Lifestyle with its casual gurus and myriad conveniences.<br /><br />When his beloved wife Maria died of cancer, disconsolate and without moorings, he turned to her much younger caregiver for love - a quality conspicuous by the rarity of its occurrence in his hyper-intellectual heart. <br /><br />They were married at a no-frills marriage boutique in Nevada. They explored Eastern religions through Vedanta, then a current fad. They attended séances and summoned the ghost of his late wife. But all was not well.<br /><br />His doctor told him some disturbing news: he was going blind. Losing his sight would be losing his most precious pleasure: reading. So his doctor advised him to frequently rest his eyes, by closing them and then applying light pressure from his palms, gently circling them in a clockwise motion.<br /><br />He was very much a faddish man without roots, and much akin in his casual though refined nature to the citizens of the Brave New World. He Needed to read and write. He was a sensual man who needed his pleasures.<br /><br />But with the approach of the sixties, he received another grim diagnosis. Cancer of the mouth. He started to compare notes with his friend Stravinsky about their planned abstinence from cigarettes:<br /><br />The weeds that killed him in the end.<br />***<br /><br />Carl Jung used to say that our Shadow will visit us in our dreams if we ignore it in our daily lives...<br /><br />Huxley bought into the mainstream Freudian POV that the asceticism of the great mystics was mere dumb sexual repression (witness his Late anti-Christian rant entitled The Devils of Loudon - now made newly available on Kindle).<br /><br />And late in life, close to the time of his own death, Huxley dreamt he was floating in a vast orb containing a marvellous city. <br /><br />But outside the bubble, brutish crowds were howling with derisive laughter at him - yes, him - the untouchable visionary who penned the great Brave New World!<br /><br />It’s like that late photo of him at his misunderstood California friend Stravinsky’s recording sessions for his own new severely serial and segmented short compositions.<br /><br />Huxley marvelled at the capacious mind of the composer of the Sacre, but his small-souled trivial brain had no clue of the older man’s unimpeachable moral integrity. <br /><br />A wannabe mystic, he was a no-show at the starting gate of Heaven because he could never focus his thoughts long enough to shore up enough justifications for a undying Faith.<br /><br />He awoke from that dream in a panic.<br /><br />Poor, dear lost soul that he was, there were times when even Soma wouldn't help...<br /><br />And in his quest for new utopias, he had left the rough and tumble Faith of ordinary poor workaday, believing sods out of his equation.<br /><br />For his advanced calculations noisily and brusquely precluded the one and only possible healing panacea for his soul - the Simplicity of the Holy Spirit.<br /><br />For that’s ALL he had ever needed, had he understood Stravinsky and the common folk well.",3

"<i>Brave New World</i> is a young man's novel, written in the interwar years. Huxley was then living in a collapsing world: a world where the optimist 19th-century dreams of progress, of improved humanity, of a new and superior man, had been shattered in the trench warfare of World War I and were about to be burned amidst the horrors of the concentration camps.<br /><br />Huxley seems to be sensing that grave danger is looming on the horizon, and he imagines a utopia where a single superstate is ruling the whole planet. The dream of a “superior humanity” has eventually come true, thanks to the extensive use of eugenics and mass cloning (babies in bottles). Not all people get the best genetic formula, however: some of these manufactured humans are reduced to imbecility, perform the lowest functions, and are nonetheless content with their lot. Children, of course, are all brainwashed and conditioned with hypnotic techniques (sleep teaching). There are no families anymore, and sexual promiscuity is pervasive. Adults get a further supply of silly entertainment (Feelies) and drugs (Soma) that renders them docile, keeps them young, and make them love their voluntary servitude. People have lost interest in art and science, and religion has been replaced by Henry Ford’s cult (i.e. assembly line applied to human beings) and occasional orgiastic ceremonies (orgy-porgies). In short, humanity has achieved <i>happiness</i> and reached the End of History.<br /><br />To some extent, Huxley’s prophecies have become a reality, less than a century later: rational, hierarchical, hyper-efficient and optimised capitalism and cheery consumerism have conquered most of the world. The sexual revolution has indeed taken place — although full sexual libertarianism is still a pipe dream. Pharmacopoeia, narcotics, antidepressants, tranquillisers and rejuvenating treatments are broadly available; as well as irrelevant and mind-numbing 3D entertainment, peppered with commercial slogans. Genetic engineering and biotechnology are everywhere (although not used to select humans as yet).<br /><br /><i>Brave New World</i> is a novel structured around a set of (rather crude) characters and plots; there is, however, no clear protagonist. Huxley has a witty tongue-in-cheek sense of humour throughout. Some passages even have a purely poetic or musical quality: particularly through the use of <a href=""https://goodreads.com/author/show/947.William_Shakespeare"" title=""William Shakespeare"" rel=""noopener"">Shakespeare</a>’s lines for the character of John Savage, or the cross-cutting technique employed in chapter 3. But by and large, the book feels like a philosophical essay or social satire, in the style of Voltaire’s <a href=""https://goodreads.com/book/show/19380.Candide"" title=""Candide by Voltaire"" rel=""noopener"">Candide</a> or Swift’s <a href=""https://goodreads.com/book/show/7733.Gulliver_s_Travels"" title=""Gulliver's Travels by Jonathan Swift"" rel=""noopener"">Gulliver's Travels</a>. Obviously, Huxley had Plato’s <a href=""https://goodreads.com/book/show/30289.The_Republic"" title=""The Republic by Plato"" rel=""noopener"">Republic</a> in mind, when designing his Alpha / Bêta / Gamma / Delta / Epsilon caste system (he was probably also referring to the school grades: A+ to F, already in use when he was a pupil at Eton College, or even to the caste system in India). Certainly, he remembered Nietzsche’s “<i>Letzte Mensch</i>” from <a href=""https://goodreads.com/book/show/51893.Thus_Spoke_Zarathustra"" title=""Thus Spoke Zarathustra by Friedrich Nietzsche"" rel=""noopener"">Zarathustra</a>’s prologue: a human type that has indeed invented happiness, comfort and social stability, but ultimately a petty and lethargic sort of humankind. A type of humanity that might well be appealing to us right now, who knows…<br /><br /><i>Brave New World</i> is obviously a fascinating political statement that spoke to the European crisis of the 1930s. But its visionary impact and influence on speculative fiction cannot be overstated, from Orwell’s <a href=""https://goodreads.com/book/show/5470.1984"" title=""1984 by George Orwell"" rel=""noopener"">1984</a> to Bradbury’s <a href=""https://goodreads.com/book/show/4381.Fahrenheit_451"" title=""Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury"" rel=""noopener"">Fahrenheit 451</a>, to Atwood's <a href=""https://goodreads.com/book/show/46756.Oryx_and_Crake__MaddAddam___1_"" title=""Oryx and Crake (MaddAddam, #1) by Margaret Atwood"" rel=""noopener"">Oryx and Crake</a>, and to Houellebecq’s <a href=""https://goodreads.com/book/show/996096.La_Possibilit__d_une__le"" title=""La Possibilité d'une île by Michel Houellebecq"" rel=""noopener"">La Possibilité d'une île</a>.<br /><br />See also my review of <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1914345618"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Brave New World Revisited</a>.<br /><br /><i>Edit</i>: Watched Universal’s 2020 <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brave_New_World_(2020_TV_series)"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">TV series adaptation</a>. It is by and large faithful to the novel’s plot and characters, but ends up taking more and more liberties as the episodes go by. It’s also focusing way more on the entertainment potential of the book (especially the erotica aspects of the orgy-porgies) than on the political debate around the problem of happiness vs freedom. All references to Shakespeare have been removed as well, although the romance is a central part of the show (not so much in the book). Ultimately, Huxley’s philosophical novel serves as the rib cage of the series, but its heart is more like <i>Black Mirror</i>, <i>Westworld</i>, <i>The Matrix</i> or even Fritz Lang’s <i>Metropolis</i>. Nonetheless, a pleasant “feely” with some nice eye candy!",4
"As a teenager I went through a period of reading a vast number of distopian novels - probably all the teenage angst. This is the one that has continued to haunt me however, long after the my youthful cynicism has died it's death. It's basically a book about the utopian ideal - everyone's happy, everyone has what they want and EVERYTHING is based on logical principles. However, there is something very rotten at the heart. It's about how what we want isn't always what we should get. It looks at how state sponsered ""happiness"" can entirely miss the point. Perhaps, most importantly, it makes the case for individual freedom rather than authoritarian diktat. It should be read hand in hand with Mill's Utilitarianism to get a good idea of the philosophy that inspired it.<br /><br />Incidentally, I gave this book to my boyfriend as a present for his 18th birthday ( a rather depressing gift I know). At the time he wasn't particularly freaked out by it and said that it didn't hold the same level of dread as say, 1984 or ""The Handmaid's Tale"". As he's got older however, he's found the idea more and more frightening. Six years later it has more of a sting in the tail for him. I don't know why this should be but I'll hazard a guess that as you get older you're idea of ""happiness"" becomes perhaps more complex, making the ideal of ""Brave New World"" even more disturbing.",5
"I would like to be an intellectual.<br /><br />In an ideal world, I wear a monocle, and I have a pocket watch on a chain, and all of my sweaters have elbow patches.

I read literary fiction the most of any genre. I used to have a quest where I would have to read at least one classic every month, but I retired it because I typically read more than that.

I tend to rate books from those two categories higher than others.<br /><br />But still, we find ourselves here.<br /><br />I didn't like this book.

"<b><i>Brave New World</i> is a classic written to make its readers uncomfortable.</b> It accomplishes its point well. Still, it is only getting 3 stars from me, as I rate books based on my personal level of enjoyment rather than literary value. <br /><br />The characters of this book were not meant to be likeable - I am fine with that concept. <b>The first few chapters made me want to curl up in the corner and cry</b> - that's how repulsive the design of this universe was (mission accomplished, Mr. Huxley). But as we plunge into the depths of the neverending moral message of the story (basically the entire last third of the book), I felt my patience stretching thin<i>. <b>I get the message, no need to beat me over the head with it</b>.</i><br /><br />I did chuckle at the ridiculous consumerism of this world (inspired by America of the turn of the century) in which, unexpectedly, most characters have distinct socialist names - Lenina, Trotsky, Marx, Bernard (as in G.B.Shaw). I just think it's funny how both of the enemies of Huxley's ideal world - the competing ideologies of socialism and rampant consumerism - were dealt with in one blow. Good try - but <i>come on</i>!<br /><br />I liked the description of the effects of soma drug on the mind. No wonder, as this was written by the author of <a href=""https://goodreads.com/book/show/3188964.The_Doors_of_Perception"" title=""The Doors of Perception by Aldous Huxley"" rel=""noopener"">The Doors of Perception</a> about mescaline effects on the mind - an interesting read, by the way.<br /><br />Of the classic trio of dystopian books (this one, Orwell's <i>Nineteen Eighty-Four</i> and Zamyatin's <i>We</i>) this one is my least favorite (<i>We</i> is the best, in my opinion, and may have actually inspired this one). <i>Brave New World</i> succeeds at portraying dystopia at its worst and making the reader think, but stilted language and moral heavy-handedness take away from the enjoyment. <b>Yet it's a classic, and should be read, even if not for fun.</b> 3 stars.",3
"<b>”I feel I could do something much more important. Yes, and more intense, more violent. But what? What is there more important to say? And how can one be violent about the sort of things one’s expected to write about? Words can be like X-rays, if you use them properly--they’ll go through anything. You read and you’re pierced.”</b><br /><br />Aldous Huxley was prompted to write this book in the early 1930s because he feared the direction society was heading. The worship of material goods, the embracement of capitalism, the promiscuity, the growing ambivalence towards books, the self-medication to escape reality, and the overall vacuousness of people, in general.<br /><br />The book begins rather awkwardly in the lab where people are being created. A massive, industrial, test tube baby factory with very little variety, after all, they have determined the very best specimens so why create anything else? Note to self: rewatch the movie <i>Gattaca</i>. We do meet Lenina in the lab, an uncommonly pretty woman, who feels a pat on a fanny by her supervisor is a reassurance that all is well. Note to self: #metoo movement needs a time machine. <br /><br />Huxley read a book on Henry Ford, who was certainly the poster child for industry and capitalism. In this book, he has become a deity of sorts. <b>”Oh for Ford’s Sake!”</b> a character thunders. Note to self: Start using Ford for Fuck and see if anyone has a clue where such a use of the word came from. <br /><br /><b>”We don’t want people attracted by old things. We want them to like the new ones.”</b> Rampant consumerism is the only way to keep the merry-go-round turning. Fortunately, by using brainwashing techniques while everyone sleeps, they can implant the proper desires and prejudices that will make for a united and happy society. <br /><br />Lenina has become hung up on a guy by the name of Henry Foster. She hasn’t been with another man for four months. She is dangerously close to being accused of monogamy. Her friend is appalled and reminds her that <i>”everyone belongs to everyone else.”</i> A woman being “allowed” and even encouraged to be promiscuous would seem like evolution, but when it becomes an obligation to be promiscuous, it feels like just another form of oppression. Sex has become a plaything to keep the masses happy. <br /><br />They also have soma, which is the ultimate happy pill. Anytime things become too real, they pop a tab of soma or three. <i>”Christianity without tears--that’s what soma is.”</i> It bleeds all meaning out of life, leaving the user complacent and happy and completely oblivious to whatever had been bothering them in the first place. It feels more than a bit like the opioid epidemic that we are struggling with currently; only soma is made readily available to all who need it and seems to have been carefully manufactured to avoid overdoses. Overdoses would definitely be a downer that would create some of that much feared unhappiness. #opiodcrisis<br /><br /><b>What kind of life would it be to feel nothing?</b><br /><br />Bernard Marx has been trying to get Lenina to do something with him for some time. He is a bit of an odd duck among these carefully designed people. A Danny Devito among a herd of Arnold Schwarzeneggers. Note to self: Rewatch <i>Twins</i>, just because it is such a hoot. There is much speculation that something went wrong in the lab, a bit too much of this or too little of that leaked into his test tube. Needless to say, he is testy about it. After all, why does he look like this while his siblings look like that? He finally convinces Lenina to go with him to an Indian reservation in America, where they meet the natives who have been untouched by technology. They get old. They get sick. They die young. They give birth. This is a #povertyporn trip similar to white westerns driving through African villages so they can point and say things like...can you believe people live like this? Bernard is there really to feel something. Lenina is there to become overcome by all the squalor and unfamiliar feelings of discomfort, but she is glad she came because she is going to rock her #Facebook page when she gets back. <br /><br />Bernard decides to bring a white Savage back with him. He is the product of a lustful coupling by Bernard’s boss, and believe me Bernard needs all the leverage he can get with his boss. The Savage is reading, not only reading, but reading Shakespeare. Can you imagine a person learning to read from Shakesepeare being integrated into an uneducated society such as this? Note to self: Read Othello. The Savage is primitive and a thinker, and this will prove to be a dangerous combination. He will see the absurdity in everything. He will protest violently...how dare he? <br /><br /><b>”O Brave New World!”</b><br /><br />Can one man bring truth to the masses? It will be a nearly impossible task, given that the masses don’t even know they need saving. <br /><br />I had forgotten about all the humor in the book. Huxley is poking fun at nearly everything we hold sacred. Satire is the perfect vehicle for modern comedians like John Oliver, Jon Stewart, Stephen Colbert, Samantha Bee, and Bill Maher to make their political points and make their audience laugh as well. We seem to need our truths given to us with a dose of sugar. Even in this futuristic utopia, Huxley called it a negative utopia, the population still needs healthy doses of soma to keep up the pretense that everything is fine. The people who rebel are those who find integration to be a problem or, like Bernard, feel disadvantages from the very beginning of their life. One size does not fit all, even when everyone is manufactured to be the same. A society will always be judged by the tolerance it shows for those different than the majority. <br /><br />If you wish to see more of my most recent book and movie reviews, visit <a target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" href=""http://www.jeffreykeeten.com"">http://www.jeffreykeeten.com</a><br />I also have a Facebook blogger page at:<a target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" href=""https://www.facebook.com/JeffreyKeeten"">https://www.facebook.com/JeffreyKeeten</a> and an Instagram account <a target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" href=""https://www.instagram.com/jeffreykeeten/"">https://www.instagram.com/jeffreykeeten/</a>",4
"Given that dystopian books are generally not my first choice ‘run-to-books-to-read’.... and I’m sure I didn’t understand the full depths of this book - which was written 21 years before I was born....even I can see Aldous Huxley had a brilliant mind. <br /><br /> I was trying to wrap my thinking around the conspiracies that it looked liked the author was trying to warn us were happening in the world —�trying to visualize the already futuristic setting —( was he thinking of 2017?)....and follow the story itself, trying to get inside the heads of the created characters. <br />See... I’m not very good at this. This type of reading is challenging for me. It hurts my brain!!!!<br /><br />But.....here are a few things I think I got from this book:<br />.....thousands of little babies got born from one cell.....but not from a mothers womb....and these were the SORRY SUCKERS...( too bad for you Johnny - you’re pretty much a worthless bean- and you get to have all the shitty underpaid jobs in the world). <br />.....embryos were incubated in bottles in laboratories.<br />.....there were no traditional ‘Leave It To Beaver’ families in this society - there were no families at all - no sexual reproduction at all! <br />.....there is a REASON for all this. Embryos were divided by their social status. There were five castes: alpha, beta, (THE LUCKY SUCKERS).....and delta, gamma, and epsilon.....(the SORRY SUCKERS)......<br /><br />Oh but wait the SORRY SUCKERS won’t feel sorry for themselves because this is utopia....where everybody is made to be happy - as all personal identity has vanished. DRUGS ARE COOL.... even encouraged! Everybody must get stoned.<br /><br />So? How am I doing? Am I understanding this book somewhat? <br /> ...that what Aldous Huxley was saying is that the FUTURE LOOKS SCARY?/!....<br />It looked scary in 1931.... and it still looks scary in 2017. <br />One of Huxley’s predictions was spot on: Bombastic- pretentious -pompous RIDICULOUS senatorial entertainment! ( Huxley was more kind and didn’t use all those adjectives)....but he might have if he knew how right he’d really be! <br /><br />Lots more in this slim-jim novel - we get enlightened on history - religion - consumerism- emotions ( not to worry - you won’t need to worry - it’s a no worry society).... we’ve become deadbeats!<br /><br />PLEASE read other reviews- I have NO idea if I read this book right. <br />However ...seems like I shouldn’t worry about it all according to the brilliant man himself...Aldous Huxley! VERY WORTH READING! ( even for a girl who understands nothin) <br /><br /><br />Whew.... now I can start my day.... as all is well in the world. 🌏",4
"Back in high school, one of the teachers brought a little sample from this book, and I found it totally captivating. Terrifying but at the same captivating. <br /><br />So, I went back to it. <br /><br /><b>
  <i>“One believes things because one has been conditioned to believe them.”<br /></i>
</b><br /><br />The beginning is totally the strongest part of this book, as it progresses, it goes a bit down. But at the same time, I think that the beginning is the hardest to get over. The world is being introduced to us in a rather raw way which definitely has the potential to make people uneasy. And while it was hard to read but it was also fascinating in a way. You do not like what you see, but you cannot look away. <br /><br />However, the book gave me chills; it's definitely not a ""summer-read"", it's quite a bit to unpack and get over what's happening. <br /><br />Side note, I just hope that no one ever looks at this book and thinks that it's a great idea.

"For fans of 1984…..<br /><br />Brave New World is a dystopian novel published in 1932. Reproduction occurs in a lab. The government conditions children to hate books and flowers while the government promotes certain products (like sports that require a lot of equipment). Everyone looks the same and has similar names. <br /><br />The government conditions people through a program of predestiny, and instead of saying “Our Lord,” the people say, “Our Ford.”<br /><br />The book itself is a bit rough at times, particularly in the beginning which is too focused on statistics and numbers. <br /><br />However, there is a lot to think about in this book. Although I don’t know the exact social mores of the 1930’s, many of the ideas expressed in Brave New World are accurate today.<br /><br />Consumerism is still a founding principle in the United States where consumer debt is at an all-time high between mortgages, credit cards, student loans, and auto loans. The idea is that one always needs more, more, more. <br /><br />Now, let’s talk about predestiny. If you just work hard, you can be anything, right? <br /><br />You could be the next Bill Gates, right?<br /><br />Let’s look at the education of some of the wealthiest people in the world.<br /><br />Bill Gates: He went to a private school, Lakeside prep. According to the Lakeside School website, the tuition for the 2023-2024 school year is $42,000. That isn’t for college. This is for high school.<br /><br />Mark Zuckerberg: He attended a private school as well, Phillips Exeter Academy. According to its website, tuition for the 2023-2024 school year is $50,604. <br /><br />Jeff Bezos: He attended Miami Palmetto High School and even worked at McDonald’s. However, he also participated in the Student Science Training Program at the University of Florida. According to the website, this is a “rigorous and fast paced program for academically talented and motivated students.” The program costs $5,200 plus a $50 application fee.<br /><br />We talk about predestiny. It seems like we, as a society, need to invest more in education.<br /><br /><b>Connect With Me!</b><br /><a href=""https://lisaoftroy.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Blog</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/Lisa_of_Troy"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Twitter</a> <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvmSewQ0IGOzDnuMZNUKTbg"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">BookTube</a> <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/LisaofTroy"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Facebook</a> <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/lisa_of_troy/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Insta</a>",5
"<b>DNF @ 50%</b><br /><br />I know, I know. I'm a peabrain pleb and this is truly a classic and <i>how dare I?</i><br /><br />I understand what it's trying to do. I understand the over-enthusiasm for science and the depersonalization. I understand how showing a thriving world devoid of relationships and emotions feels counterintuitive and wrong. (<i>'That's the point!'</i> I understand that's the part that's supposed to <i>'make you think!'</i>) I understand how the conditioning and predestination of this ""utopia"" sacrifices individuality for compliance and just whoaaaa<br /><br />I even understand that the frickin orgies and the special drug (""Soma"") are representative of the way the people shed their own identities and continue to live a unified existence. <br /><br /><b>I understand how ground-breaking this was.</b> I understand it raises all sorts of questions and opens discussions about free will, societal control, the role of government and <i>what humanity is.</i><br /><br />But it's not for me. This is incredibly dense as the <i>entire</i> first half has been dedicated to showing the science and structure of this 'brave new world.' There's not really a plot and there's not really even characters? (I mean <i>kinda?</i>) It all feels dedicated to driving the same few points home.<br /><br />I understand. But I'm bored. And I'm tired of the shock-factor of orgies and children engaging in ""erotic play"" <br /><br />(This really could have been a short-story and it would have accomplished the same things)",1
"""You all remember,"" said the Controller, in his strong deep voice, ""you all remember, I suppose, that beautiful and inspired saying of Our Ford's: History is bunk. History, "" he repeated slowly, ""is bunk."" <br /> <br />The rhetorical skills of the Controller remind me of the Epsilon Semi-Moron who runs one of the bravest new worlds in our current era in bunk. <br /> <br />As I had forgotten the major plot of this dystopian novel written just when fascism emerged in the 1930s, some fifteen years before the nuclear age, I spent a day rereading it with mixed emotions. Some things are almost prophetic in all their scary details, for example the efficiency of the childlike custom-made contributor to consumerist society:<br /><br />""Adults intellectually and during working hours"", he went on. ""Infants where feeling and desire are concerned.""<br /><br />The reliable drug - soma - which makes sure that society's stability is not threatened, the focus on entertainment which requires people to spend money on gadgets that keep the economy working, the sexual control mechanisms (for promiscuity is just as limiting as marriage or chastity if you are not given any choice), the early childhood social conditioning in addition to biological selection processes - it all leaves a bitter taste as it rings too many bells.<br /><br />The part of the plot I found difficult to swallow was the juxtaposition of the scientifically perfected ""utopia"" of drug-induced happiness with the dirty ""natural"" world of the savages, who follow absurdly ancient rituals. Their world, where ""god"" is still needed to balance their suffering and to help them accept ageing, hunger and pain, is like a black-and-white contrast foil. Their need for self-denial in God-fearing doesn't generally differ much from the self-indulgence of the consumption society where soma takes care of controlling emotions and actions. In either case, human beings are controlled, or conditioned, by a greater power, and they can fall back into a state of irresponsible acceptance of pleasure or pain, according to their choice (- which of course is pre-destined by early childhood drilling).<br /><br />Call me a hopeless idealist, but there is a third alternative! <br /><br />Human beings can be offered the freedom of choice if they learn to embrace diversity, knowledge and differences of individuals rather than the ""utopian"" goal of ""sameness"" of one kind or the other. If sameness is the ultimate goal, any paradise will turn into hell, an automatic regression into robotic behaviour will follow, regardless of the oppressive dictatorship that imposes it (consumerism and religious doctrine are quite the same in Brave New World).<br /><br />Interestingly, Huxley himself commented on the problematic binary world he had created when he reflected on his novel in 1946. His third option, to decentralise power and encourage individual freedom, is still a work in progress in our historical (bunk) era, and his two dystopian visions have merged into one. The worship of His Fordship, the consumerist god of the capitalist world, has been combined with ancient religious rites serving as soma for some people, while others take the more direct approach of over-consumption of food and fun and drug intake against meaninglessness. It made me think of another novel showing two juxtaposed oppressive systems, <a href=""https://goodreads.com/book/show/37781.Things_Fall_Apart"" title=""Things Fall Apart by Chinua Achebe"" rel=""noopener"">Things Fall Apart</a>. British colonial rule, with all its religious and social implications, stands against the ancient rites of the Nigerian past, which to me would constitute just as much of a dictatorship against my personal wishes. Two opposing, rigid systems leaving no individual freedom, two doctrines that condemn whatever is different from their own specific tradition. Zero tolerance for individual differences. No compromise or combination possible. It is either or. No third or fourth option.<br /><br />""Oh Ford"" can be used as casually as ""Oh Lord"" (of whichever confession), and has about as much impact. Margaret Atwood in her <a href=""https://goodreads.com/book/show/17262203.MaddAddam__MaddAddam___3_"" title=""MaddAddam (MaddAddam, #3) by Margaret Atwood"" rel=""noopener"">MaddAddam</a> at least insisted that her new deity ""Oh Fuck"" should only be called upon in emergencies.<br /><br />I finish reading Brave New World with the feeling that it is time to call on Atwood's god, for the bravest and newest of worlds is in danger. The devil is in the sameness, as is god. For they are the same thing, utopia and dystopia being completely identical, turning humans into Epsilon Semi-Morons, children or robots. Even Shakespeare can be destroyed by application in banal situations. If history is bunk, everything is always new and brave. But also meaningless.<br /><br />Oh Fuck!",5
"In a dystopian society of genetically engineered consumers pacified by drugs and conditioning, Bernard Marx cannot seem to fit in. When he visits a Savage reservation, his eyes are opened and he brings one of the savages back to England with him...<br /><br />As I continue my bleak science fiction parade toward the new year, I wonder why I've never read Brave New World before.<br /><br />In Brave New World, Aldous Huxley takes on consumerism, the media, genetic engineering, recreational drugs, religion, herd mentality, individualism, and lots of other socially relevant topics, weaving them into a science fiction setting that our world resembles more every day.<br /><br />The setting and society are the stars of the show in Brave New World. The people live in a caste system based on genetics, conditioned from birth and pacified by drugs, living to consume goods and take soma to forget their troubles. Free love is encouraged but free thinking is not. Bernard Max can't seem to get with the program and winds up nearly causing a revolution.<br /><br />The characters are pretty secondary to the setting but it wasn't hard to feel sorry for Bernard, the square peg in a world of round holes. Even when he gets a measure of fame, he still can't manage to shake the feeling that something's wrong. John the Savage provides a nice contrast, an outsider looking in on a world everyone else sees as normal but he sees as hellish.<br /><br />Huxley may not have thought so at the time but he may have been a futurist. Our culture seems to be moving in the direction of Brave New World all the time. The rampant consumerism, lowest common denominator entertainment, and herd mentality all seem a little too familiar. Is the internet our soma? Things to ponder...<br /><br />There are some classics that are as hard to read as an insurance policy written in Klingon and then there are ones like this. Brave New World is very readable and not at all dense. The ideas are very easy to absorb, especially in this day and age. In these uncertain times, Brave New World is as timely as ever. Four and a half stars.<br />",4
"In my head, the purpose of this review is very clear. It is to convince <b>YOU</b> to read this book. Yes, you! Waste time no more. Go grab a copy.<br><br>Machiavellian intrigue, mythology, religion, politics, imperialism, environmentalism, the nature of power. All this set in a mind-boggling, frighteningly original world which Herbert ominously terms as an ""effort at prediction"". Dune had me hooked!<br><br><b>First impression</b><br><br>The very first stirring I felt upon opening the yellowed pages of Dune was that of stumbling upon an English translation of an ancient <b>Arabic</b> manuscript of undeniable power and potence which had an epic story to narrate. The tone was umistakably sombre and I realized Herbert was not here to merely entertain me, he was here to make me part of the legend of <b>Muad'Dib</b>. It was intriguing and challenging and heck, since I live for challenges I decided to take this one up too, gladly. The challenge was the complexity and depth of the plot, which left me perplexed, in the beginning. I knew there were dialogues which meant much more than their superficial meaning and was unable to grasp at it. I felt a yawning chasm between Herbert's vision and my limited understanding of it. However, of course, I plodded on and could feel the gap closing in with every page much to my joy and relief. <br><br><b>The Foreword</b><br><br>""To the people whose labours go beyond ideas into the realm of 'real materials'- to the dry-land ecologists, wherever they may be, in whatever time they work, this <b>effort at prediction</b> is dedicated in humility and admiration."" <br><br>The foreword makes it pretty clear that Frank Herbert isn't kidding around. This is a serious effort at predicting how our world is going to look two thousand years from now and by God, it's a bloody good and detailed prediction. However, the real merit in this effort lies in the commentary on our lives in the present.<br><br><b>Why Frank Herbert is a genius</b><br><br>The setting of the book is arid futuristic. the plot is driven by political mind games reminiscent of The Game of Thrones. The issues he tackles are as modern as the colour television. Herbert's genius manifests itself in his ability to combine the past, the present and the future in one sweeping elegant move called Dune.<br><br><b>Plot and Setting</b><br><br>Dune is set in a futuristic technologically advanced world which after the <b>Butlerian Jihad</b> (the bloody war between Man and Machines) has eliminated all computers and passed a decree declaring <b>""Thou shalt not make a machine in the likeness of a man's mind""</b>. Since there are no computers, the essential working of the galaxy is still <b>medieval</b> and <b>feudal</b> with heavy reliance on men and their dallying around. Lots of thriller potential right there. Men with superhuman analytical abilities called <b>Mentats</b> have taken the place of Computers. On the other hand, we have the <b>Bene Gesserit</b>, an ancient school of mental and physical training for female students (it gives them superhuman intuitive powers) who follow a selective breeding program which makes them feared and mistrusted through the Imperium. Their desired end product of this breeding program is the <b>Kwisatz Haderach</b>, a superman who’ll be able to glimpse into the future. How he’ll be able to do this is rooted in Herbert’s idea of determinism: given that one can observe everything and analyze everything, one can effectively glimpse the future in probabilistic terms. Quantum physics anyone? The <b>Kwisatz Haderach</b> is the proposed solution to the male-female dichotomy, between the analytical and intuitive.<br><br>The plot of Dune is almost wholly set on the desert planet of <b>Arrakis</b> (also referred to as Dune), an arid wasteland where water is so scarce that men have to wear stillsuits which recycle human moisture for further consumption. The source of the galaxy’s interest in the planet is <b>Melange</b>, a spice which bestows upon one longevity and prescient powers. Everything on the planet is permeated with the spice, the air, the sand, the food. Everybody on the planet is hopelessly addicted to the spice, their only hope for survival being their continued intake of the spice. The <b>Spacing Guild</b>, the economic and trading monopolistic arm of the Galaxy badly needs the spice for interstellar transport. This is because their frigates travel faster than the speed of light and hence travel backward in time. The spice is the only way they can look into the future and see their way ahead. How cool is that! All the powers on the Galaxy are out to mine the spice, braving the sandworms, their name merely an euphemism, for they are gigantic 200 metre long creatures which always come digging through the sand whenever spice mining is undertook. <b>Always</b>. There’s also another little glitch. There exist on the planet, the kickass native desert tribal <b>Fremen</b>, whom the foreign powers look down with suspicion and disdain. The <b>Fremen</b> ethos is one of survival and scarcity, driven by tribalism and egalitarianism. Okay, I’ll stop right there. No more spoilers about this. Except that they value water to the extent that spitting on a person is the highest honour they can bestow upon him.<br><br>Our protagonists are the <b>Atreides</b> family, consisting of the Duke, his Bene Gesserit concubine Jessica and their son Paul, who have been entrusted the stewardship of Arrakis. We discover the alien planet of Arrakis along with them, firstly with fear, suspicion and wonder and ultimately, love and respect. <b>Paul Muad’Dib</b>, however is no ordinary prince. There’s a teeny weeny chance he might be the <b>Kwisatz Haderach</b>, something which troubles him constantly and gives us our conflicted hero. The poor chap <b>trips balls</b> over the spice and has visions of black hordes pillaging and murdering around town bearing his flag and sees his dead body multiple times.<br><br>My favourite character, however has to be the <b>Baron Vladmir Harkonnen</b>, the most evil character I’ve ever come across in my literary excursions. He is ruddy ruthlessness, he is virile villainy, he is truculent treachery. He executes the inept chess players in his employ which says oodles about his badassery and his fondness for cold-blooded logic. He sees everything in simplistic <b>chess</b> terms. What is my best move? What is my opponent’s best move? Is there anything I can do to completely squash his move? Is there a tactic which leads to mate in three? <br><br><b>Themes</b><br><br>In this setting, Herbert does so much, it’s unbelievable. Religion, politics, the dynamic nature of power, the effects of colonialism, our blatant destruction of our environment are themes which run parallel to the intensely exciting and labyrinthine plot. He shows the paramount importance of myth making and religion for power to sustain over long periods of time. <b>Man, as a political animal is laid completely bare.</b><br><br><b>Real life</b><br><br>Now these are my thoughts about what Herbert could have meant to be Arrakis-<br><br><img src=""https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1380347339i/701681.png"" width=""270"" height=""270"" alt=""description"" class=""gr-hostedUserImg"" loading=""lazy""> <br><br>It makes perfect sense. Herbert draws heavy inspiration for the religious ideology of Muad’Dib from Islam. He says “When religion and politics ride in the same cart and that cart is driven by a living Holy man, nothing can stand in the path of such a people.” which is the philosphy of the politics of Islam. Islamism in a nutshell. <br><br>The spice, much desired by everyone, is the oil. Baron Vladmir Harkonnen is symblomatic of the wily Russians. The Desert foxes Fremen are representative of the native Saudi desert-dwelling Bedouin tribe who have a strongly tribe-oriented culture and undoubtedly value water in equal measure. And the ultimate loser is the environment.<br><br><b>Why do good books get over?</b><br><br>I almost forget this is a science fiction novel, it’s that real. It is also scary and prophetic. It is a reading experience that will leave you dreaming of the grave emptiness of Arrakis and make you wish you were there to brave it all in the privileged company of the noble Fremen. Frank Herbert achieves the pinnacle of what a sci-fi author aspires to rise to; authentic world building.",5

"Let me start by first apologizing to everyone who loves this classic. I don't doubt <i>Dune</i> was something special when it first came out in the 1960s. But reading it for the first time today, it feels horribly outdated to me and at times almost incomprehensible.<br /><br />I was warned going into this story that the beginning is extremely hard to understand, but that is an understatement. I could barely follow its scene after scene of dialogue referencing people and places and events, all with no explanation or context. It literally feels like I was just dropped into the middle of a book, and everything had already been explained elsewhere.<br /><br />But it gets better, right? Well, only somewhat. A narrative does take shape, but the writing style remains confusing and obscure. It manages to be both long-winded and not clear enough, if you can believe that. Certain obvious points are harped on again and again, but other crucial ones are merely glossed over. Then, when you inevitably miss those important points, they create this cascading effect that keeps you mired in confusion.<br /><br />The writing is also pretentious, with regular or nonsensical things consistently being presented in a profound way. There are plenty of extraneous paragraphs that sound good until you try to discern their meaning, at which point you'd be stumped. This sort of writing really confused me because I couldn't figure out which paragraphs mattered and needed to be dissected carefully to suss out their hidden meaning, and which ones are just adornment.<br /><br />As for the story itself, it was a complete mismatch with my interests. I like science fiction with lots of real science. Instead, this is a space opera (a.k.a. a soap opera that takes place in space) with no actual science. It's all political intrigue, melodrama, doublespeak, and who has power over who, which I have zero interest in. I also couldn't care less about how fawningly amazing Paul is and how he is destined to be the chosen one.<br /><br />This was such a frustrating reading experience because it could've been an amazing story. And there were moments in the beginning when I thought it was going in those creative directions. I was riveted during that infamous test in the first scene, only to realize that it was completely irrelevant to the rest of the story. Or to see where the book could take the scientific aspects of a desert planet and a population with so little water, which it didn't other than a bit of lip service.<br /><br />But the book stubbornly chose to disregard these more interesting avenues, and instead took the most straightforward, boring route of making this into a story about power struggle. Well, we could've saved ourselves the bother and just stayed on Earth for that.",2
"There's a characteristically witty essay by Borges about a man who rewrites <i>Don Quixote</i>, many centuries after Cervantes. He publishes a novel with the same title, containing the same words in the same order. But, as Borges shows you, the different cultural context means it's a completely new book! What was once trite and commonplace is now daring and new, and vice versa. It just happens to <i>look</i> like Cervantes's masterpiece.<br /><br />Similarly, imagine the man who was brave or stupid enough to rewrite <i>Dune</i> in the early 21st century. Like many people who grew up in the 60s and 70s, I read the book in my early teens. What an amazing story! Those kick-ass Fremen! All those cool, weird-sounding names and expressions they use! (They even have a useful glossary in the back). The disgusting, corrupt, slimy Harkonnens - don't you just love to hate them! When former-aristo-turned-desert-guerilla-fighter Paul Muad'Dib rides in on a sandworm at the end to fight the evil Baron and his vicious, cruel nephew, of course you're cheering for him. Who the hell wouldn't be?<br /><br />So that was the <i>Dune</i> we know and love, but the man who rewrote it now would get a rather different reception. Oh my God! These Fremen, who obviously speak <i>Arabic</i>, live on a desert planet which supplies the Universe with melange, a commodity essential to the Galactic economy, and in particular to transport. <i>Not</i> a very subtle way to say ""oil""! They are tough, uncompromising fighters, who are quite happy to use suicide bombing as a tactic. They're led by a charismatic former rich kid (OK, we get who you mean), who inspires them to rise up against the corrupt, degenerate... um, does he mean Westerners? Or only the US? And who <i>is</i> Baron Harkonnen intended to be? I'm racking my brains... Dubya doesn't quite seem to fit, but surely he means <i>someone</i>? Unless, of course, he's just a generic stereotype who stands for the immoral, sexually obsessed West. This is frightening. What did we do to make Frank al-Herbert hate us so much? You'd have people, not even necessarily right-wingers, appearing on TV to say that the book was dangerous, and should be banned: at the very least, it incites racial hatred, and openly encourages terrorism. But translations would sell brilliantly in Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, and a bad movie version would soon be made in Turkey.<br /><br />I honestly don't think Herbert meant any of that; but today, it's almost impossible not to wonder. If anyone reading this review is planning to rewrite <i>The Tale of Benjamin Bunny</i>, you'd better make sure you get your timing right. Who knows how it will be interpreted five years from now?<br /><br />",4
"No one should argue the importance <i>Dune</i>. It laid the foundations for a great deal of the themes and constructs in modern science fiction. Frank Herbert was as important to the genre as Isaac Asimov and Arthur Clarke. Unfortunately, just like them, he's quite dated, and his books can be a labor to read. One thing he maintained from old science fiction was prim and scientific dialogue that no one would ever actually speak. I've known many scientists, and they don't talk like this. You're not going to convince me a child does.<br /><br />The stuffy dialogue is inserted into even stuffier narrative, until it feels like nothing is organic about Herbert's prose. This is a terrible tragedy when you've got a world that he put so much effort into building - and it is an amazing feat of world-building, technically interplanetary building. But unlike J.R.R. Tolkien, who he is so frequently compared to, Herbert didn't make sure to include a great story in his world. Instead he included a story that frequently illustrated how clunky an artificial world can be, even if it's lovingly crafted. I struggled to attach or find interest in anyone, yet they're more archetypes than human beings, whose logic races past modern skepticism and whose dialogue is cloyingly artificial, the way people cared for the Hobbits, Dwarves and Rangers. In his world-building, Tolkien at least saved himself from being dated by antedating himself, and even with his illuminated prose, wrought more characteristics in just one protagonist than all of <i>Dune</i>'s cast. <br /><br />Even the political intrigue Herbert tries to fall back on was overdone in the Spy genre decades before he started this book. All fans of the ""Genre"" genres should appreciate Herbert's massive contributions, but they shouldn't pretend to enjoy the books if they don't, and they should be wary of certain pitfalls typical of science fiction that survived into his landmark work.",2

"<b>Nope. Sorry I don't get it.</b><br /><br />I was able to finish it by listening to the audiobook but I was bored throughout the whole 21h.<br /><br />So many descriptions... anyone else found the way Paul's mom describing him kinda weird?<br /><br />And let's not even mention how many times I laughed at the main female character being called Jessica.<br /><br />I'm sure I'll get plenty of comments telling me <i>it's a classic and it brought so much to the genre</i>... At the end of the day, my rating is always based on my enjoyment.",2
"While the cultural impact of this book is indisputable, I couldn't help feeling incredibly underwhelmed when reading it. Even the plot couldn't save Dune, since it's spoiled at every juncture by 'Princess Irulan' and her epigraphs before each chapter. Did no-one tell her about spoiler alerts?<br /><br />From the very first pages, this book plunges you in at the deep-end with an absurd amount of overly complex world-building, which just makes the book laborious to work through. It wasn't for me, and the post-Dune reading slump is real.",2
"60 pages in and then i DNFed. world building is literally shit in this book.<br /> i wanted to read this book just in case i accidentally bumped into Timothée or Zendaya but i really tried being ✨that bitch✨ but ✨that bitch✨ was not trying to be me. horrible, unreadable, and should be illegal <br />but think about it, if this book was written by a woman i just know i’d be able to actually read it cover to cover. never again ",1
just when you thought 2021 couldn't get any weirder.,5
"Dune.<br><br>No other single syllable means as much to the science fiction genre, a single word that conjures images of sandworms, spice wars, great battles between rival dynastic families and a massively detailed and intricately crafted universe. No wonder this is widely regarded as not just a Science Fiction masterpiece, but a literary achievement as well. <br><br>Like a study of Shakespeare, the reader finds that this is an archetype upon which many influences and imitators have based their works. The complexity and depth of the creation is staggering and I am continually astounded at the discipline with which Herbert must have focused his imagination.<br><br>This is the book upon which Herbert would base his greatest series and one that would outlive him as his son has continued to expand and add detail to the vast, immaculate tapestry woven by a true master of the genre. Encapsulating political, economic, sociological, biological, cultural and dynastic themes, Frank Herbert has set a high standard for later practitioners.<br><br>Brilliant.<br><br>***2015 reread - Read years later, this has lost none of its narrative power, if anything I can better appreciate the virtuoso attention to detail Herbert exhibited in his epic creation. From the perspective of having read his later 5 Dune sequels, I am astounded at the rich tapestry he has woven. Most impressive was his close omnipresence, analyzing the thoughts and minute actions and subtle nuances of his complicated dynamic interplay of characters. The exhaustive training of the Bene Gesserit and the intricate relations of the Houses and the Guild would stand as a monumental benchmark for speculative fiction ever since.<br><br>This time around I found myself looking more closely at the Harkonnens and will likely read some of Brian Herbert's additions to his fathers great work.<br><br>***2019 reread - I'm even more in love with this book and am again in awe of Herbert's narrative skill. This time around I noticed that all of the quotes that begin chapters are from Princess Irulan and I paid close attention to how Herbert crafted these interludes.<br><br>I also was drawn to the religious undertones that really began very early in the book and how Paul realized his gifts and was preparing for his role in the beginning chapters - all demonstrating Herbert's great narrative skill.<br><br>Finally, I became more aware of what a great character was Gurney Halleck. While the ghola of Duncan Idaho dominated the later books, Herbert's creation of Halleck was an enjoyable and thought provoking addition to this masterpiece. <br><br><img src=""https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1508502404i/24220544._SX540_.jpg"" width=""400"" height=""225"" alt=""description"" class=""gr-hostedUserImg"" loading=""lazy"">",5
"Update 6/27/23<br /><br />Re-read, number 15.<br /><br />This time, I read it with my daughter. Sure, it might be a bit too soon for her, but she DID insist because we'll be seeing Dune part 2 later this year. And she happens to know that I'm a rabid uberfan with no mercy or remorse. <br /><br />PLUS, I was able to read from my gorgeous new hardcover copy gifted to me by my best friend and that really does make all the difference, no?<br />ds <br /><br />Update 9/15/21<br /><br />Re-read. Number 14. <br /><br />I cannot get over how beautiful this book is. Still my favorite after all these years. It only gets better with every re-read.<br /><br /><br />Update 8/28/17<br /><br />Re-read. Number 13. :) I cry when Paul meets Gurney. I shiver when Jessica consoles Chani. I'm awestruck by the peaks and troughs of time, free-will, and the weakness in Paul even as he heroically strives against the evil that is about to be unleashed upon the universe. <br /><br />*sigh*<br /><br />Perfection. Easily the number one book I've ever read. :)<br /><br />I waver, sometimes, but right now, it is my absolute favorite. :)<br /><br /><br /><br />Original Review:<br /><br />This is a phenomenal classic of literature.<br /><br />It's not just science fiction. It transcends science fiction, as a fascinating discussion of free-will versus inevitability. Can the Jihad be denied? Can Paul ever really avoid his own death, despite seeing every time-line play out with him as the butt of every cosmic joke? Can even cruelty or mercy even remain comprehensible after such knowledge?<br /><br />Yes, I think this work outdoes Nietzsche. It certainly does a great job of making us care about the question.<br /><br />Is this all? Is this just a work that pays great justice to philosophy of action and inaction? <br /><br />Or is the novel merely a clever play at turning the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle into the physical embodiment of a man? It is that, of course. The Kwisatz Haderach can be many places at once, and he can be both alive and dead at the same time just like that certain cat.<br /><br />Is the novel a coming of age tale, first set as a mirror against his father Leto, only then to mirror the whole universe that had just turned against him? Yes, of course. He was, after all, both the product of all his upbringing and his genes, embodying the question of nature versus nurture. He was taught within many schools of martial arts and assassins, as well as training the mind in both the schools of the Mentats with their pure logic and that of the mystics, the Bene Gesserit, that allows complete control over the body down to the cellular level. And if this training wasn't enough, he was deeply schooled in politics, leadership, and the meaning of loyalty. The boy was raised right. Of course, that is nothing without ninety generations of genetic bloodline tampering from the Bene Gesserit, right? To become the fulcrum between cellular memory, tapping the minds and lives of all your genetic ancestors as well as tapping the ability to fold time and space, to become the eye of a storm of time.<br /><br />What a damn brilliant setup for one tiny character, no? His training links to the unlocking of his genes and to the life-extending and enveloping spice, Melange, to make him not merely aware of time in a theoretical sense, but eventually to be unable to discern what was in the past, the present, or the future. Here's a true Super-Man, well beyond Nietzsche.<br /><br />And don't believe for one second that this serious discussion about what would make a superior man makes for dull reading. No. We've got PLOT that's probably some of the most exciting and visceral in all of literature, driving us right into the web of intrigue, vengeance, treachery, and galactic politics. <br /><br />To quote the text, we've got ""Plans within Plans,"" and it hardly stops there. We know the House Atreides is falling into a trap laid by the Emperor and House Harkonnen, and yet free-will and pride prevents any chance to avoid it. The setup is brilliant and extremely political, giving us character sketches of some of the most brilliant and memorable characters of all time.<br /><br />Duke Leto, the Red Duke, the most honorable and beloved leader.<br />Duncan Idaho, the emotional and intuitive hero.<br />Gurney Halleck, archetypal loyalist and troubadour.<br />Lady Jessica, the woman who ought to have had all honor in life, but was unjustly reviled and set aside for political necessity. (Chani being both her mirror and her eventual glory.)<br /><br />And of course, my favorite character of all time, Paul Muad'dib Atreides, the one that would prevent the greater evils he foresaw, and went to enormous lengths and sacrifice to achieve, but who eventually failed in his task because even a god cannot overcome destiny. (Or the will of so many minds set as one.)<br /><br />So damn brilliant.<br /><br />Frank Herbert spent five years writing this treasure, working and reworking it until he published it at age 25. None of his other works come close to this masterpiece, and there's little wonder. It was birthed, fully-formed, like Athena from Zeus's head, with enormous forethought and care. <br /><br />The worldbuilding was just as carefully formed, from the ecology of Arrakis and the life-cycles of the sandworms, to the history and the creation of the Fremen from their mild beginnings as Zensunni Wanderers, adherents to the Orange Catholic Bible, to their history of oppression so like those of those who are Jewish, to their settling and hardening of their bodies and souls in the wastes of Arrakis, also just like the Jewish who carved out a place for themselves in Israel. (Current politics aside, this was a very potent idea before 1965 when Herbert wrote this, and indeed, the core is still just as powerful when you turn it back to Muslims.)<br /><br />The Galactic culture is rich and detailed. The CHOAM economic consortium, with their monopoly on space travel and their need for the Spice to allow them to see a short period into the future to plot a safe course before folding space. The Empire is caught on a knife's edge between a single power and every other House who sit in the possibility of putting aside all their squabbles for the sole purpose of checking the Emperor, if they so desired. (And Duke Atreides was such a possible popular leader among all the Great Houses, which was the primary reason the Emperor wanted him dead.) <br /><br />And of course, we have our Villains. <br /><br />The Baron Harkonnen has always been a crowd pleaser. Brilliant in his own right, devious and able to corrupt anyone with just the right sorts of pressure, including a certain absolutely trustworthy doctor we might mention.<br /><br />""The Tooth! The Tooth!"" -- You can't handle the Tooth!<br /><br />Feyd Rautha Harkonnen is especially interesting for the question of nature versus nurture.<br /><br />The Bene Gesserit had intended him to mate with Paul, who should have been Leto and Jessica's daughter, and that offspring should have been the cumulation of ninety years of a breeding experiment to recreate the Kwisatz Haderach which had come about almost by accident during the Butlerian Jihad in the deep past, to overthrow the AI overlords.<br /><br />He was practically Paul's genetic twin, or at least, his potential to be the ""One who can be many places at once"" was on par with Paul. But instead of fulfilling the kind of destiny that we get with Paul, we see him grow up under the auspices of his Uncle the Baron, becoming as cruel and devious as he was deadly. He was the argument of nurture in the conversation, of course, and having so very little of it eventually cost him his life.<br /><br />I often wonder about the directions that Dune could have taken, all those little paths in time and circumstance that could have been. What if Feyd had been brought to Arrakis earlier and overwhelmed with Spice the way that Paul had? Sure, he wouldn't have been able to convert the unconscious changes into conscious manipulation, but he might have had enough glimpses of the future, the way that the Fremen did, to have given him the edge he would have needed to kill Paul.<br /><br />And then there's a relatively minor character, Hasimir Fenring, the Emperor's personal assassin, who was nearly the Kwisatz Haderach, himself. Unable to breed true, he was still potent enough to be completely hidden to Paul's time-sight in the same way that Paul was hidden from the Spacing Guild's weaker time-sight. His training as a skilled killer was also superior to Paul. He was, by all the hints and tricks in the tale, Paul's perfect downfall. It always gives me shivers to think about, and it was only in a single instant of both recognition and pity from Paul that stayed Fenring from killing our hero. It was just a moment of whim.<br /><br />The setup was gorgeous. Paul's pity, had it been missing at his moment of greatest triumph over the Emperor, would have meant Paul's assured death. I still wonder, to this day, what stayed Frank Herbert's hand from killing his most wonderful darling. We knew the pressure of religion and politics was going to have its way upon all the oppressed peoples of Dune. The return of a monstrous religious Jihad was going to happen one way or another, sweeping across the galaxy and toppling the Empire, regardless of Paul's frantic plans and desires. Paul's own death would only mean a higher level of fanaticism, and Frank Herbert's warning against unreasoning devotion would have been made even clearer with Paul's death.<br /><br />Perhaps it was pity that stayed his hand. Who are we to say who lives and who dies?<br /><br />If you really think this review is overlong, then I apologize, but please understand that I could absolutely go on and on much longer than this. It is a symptom of my devotion to this most brilliant of all tales.<br /><br />And yes, it still holds up very, very well after twelve reads. I am quite shocked and amazed.",5

"People often forget that this series is what innovated our modern concept of science fiction (up until Neuromancer and The Martix, at least). Dune took the Space Opera and asked if it might be more than spandex, dildo-shaped rockets, and scantily-clad green women. Herbert created a vast and complex system of ancient spatial politics and peoples, then set them at one another's throats over land, money, and drugs.<br /><br />Dune is often said to relate to Sci Fi in the same way that Tolkien relates to Fantasy. I'd say that, as far as paradigm shift, this is widely true. Both entered genres generally filled with the odd, childish, and ridiculous and injected a literary sensibility which affected all subsequent authors.<br /><br />Few will challenge the importance of Star Wars' effect on film and storytelling in general, but without Dune, there would be no Star Wars. Princess Alia, the desert planet, the Spice, the Bene Gesserit, and Leto II all have direct descendants in the movies. It is unfortunate that Lucas seems to have forgotten in these later years that his best genius was pilfered from Herbert, Campbell, and Kurosawa.<br /><br />Though I have heard that the later books do not capture the same eclectic energy as the first, Dune itself is simply one of the most original and unusual pieces of Sci Fi ever written. Read it, Starship Troopers, Ringworld, Neuromancer, and Snowcrash and you'll know everything you need to about Sci Fi: that you want more.",3
"<b> <u>2021 Reread - 5*</u></b><br><br>I was totally blown away by the recent movie version of this, that much so I decided to revisit and revaluate my opinion of this extraordinary book. <br><br>So, I read it again six years on and this is something I said I would never do because I found it so difficult to read the first time. It wasn’t the complexity of the world and politics, but the narration style which totally perplexed and frustrated me. Though I think that was more to do with my immaturity as a reader at the time than anything else. This is a difficult one, but it’s worth it. <br><br>This time I was impressed with everything: the intelligence of the writing, the details of the world and the intricate nature of the storytelling. There’s just so much brilliance here. And it’s entertaining. It’s interesting. The balance is perfect. <br><br>The Freman culture is driven by ideas of ecology, efficiency and waste reduction. And whilst they are not without their faults, the sense of oneness and appreciation they have for their home planet is a strikingly important commodity. I found them fascinating to read about and of the many thing this novel has going for it, they are the jewel in Herbert’s crown. <br><br>I want to see more of this world. <br><br><u>
  <b>Original Review (2015) - 3.5*</b>
</u><br><br>I could never give Dune five stars because I really struggled to get into the novel in the beginning. It has taken me almost two months to read. This, for me, is a very long time to spend on a book. It took me so long to read because I found the writing style incredibly frustrating. I had to read whole chapters again so I could get the gist of the plot. This was more so in the beginning, which I found particularly hard to read because of the author’s way of shifting between the thoughts of multiple characters. I found this very annoying; however, I persevered over my initial despondency towards the writing, and plodded on through the book. I’m glad I did so because in the end I did come to really enjoy it. Indeed, the story is fantastic, but the writing will always remain unbearable for me. <br><br><b> A truly brilliant plot </b><br><br><img src=""https://images.gr-assets.com/photos/1435130866p8/1200257.jpg"" width=""400"" height=""198"" alt=""description"" class=""gr-hostedUserImg"" loading=""lazy""><br><br><i>Dune</i> is to science fiction what <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> is to high fantasy; it is the novel that officially, and unarguably, defines the genre. The story begins with the house of Atreides accepting the Dukedom of the planet Dune. The former Baron has been ousted by the Emperor, and is no longer of consequence. Well, that is how it initially appears. Very early on it revealed that the whole thing is a political ploy to bring the house of Atreides to its knees. The Baron lies in wait, and is ready to strike against the new, and benevolent, approach the Duke uses on the Fremen. <br><br>The Fremen are the natives of the dessert planet; thus, they know how to survive its harshness above all others. They do this through their frugal approach to water. They value it above all else, and will never waste a drop in earnest. The Baron Harkonnen, as a chide against the natives, squanders water in the cruellest ways. He, and his dinner guests, throw cups of water on the floor of the dinner hall; it was his tradition. The wasted water was soaked up with towels, which the Baron allowed the Fremen to suck the water out of. When the Duke enters he rejects this custom, and is more respectful to the Fremen way of life. He and his son and heir Paul, who is the protagonist of this novel, go as far as to try the Fremen’s grossly effective water saving suits. These Stillsuits, quite literally, recycle all the water the body wastes and feeds it back to its wearer. <br><br><b>The Fremen way is the right way</b><br><br><img src=""https://images.gr-assets.com/photos/1435130785p8/1200255.jpg"" width=""400"" height=""523"" alt=""description"" class=""gr-hostedUserImg"" loading=""lazy""><br><br>This early familiarity, with the Fremen technology, no doubt helps to keep Paul’s mind open when he is later forced to live amongst the Fremen. Paul is somewhat of a marvel; he is prophecy’s chosen one. When he eventually gains the trust of the Fremen they allow him to choose a Fermen name. He calls himself after their most revered prophet: Muad'Dib. They accept this and follow him as their leader. His inherited title of Duke dictates that he is their lord, but their religion determines their real loyalty. He has to, quite literally, fight for every ounce of their trust. Indeed, it does not come cheap, and will only be given to one who is a member of their people. <br><br><i>“Without change something sleeps inside us, and seldom awakens. The sleeper must awaken.”</i><br><br>Thus, Paul becomes their saviour. Consequently, he receives heaps of character development through this book. He goes form boy to the revered leader of a nation. The Fremen, like Paul, want the evil Baron Harkonnen gone from their planet. They do no want a cruel oppressor who is ignorant to their ways: they want Paul. I think the imagination behind the Fremen culture really is wonderful. They have efficiently adapted to survive their harsh planet. To emphasise this point you need only look at the fact that off-world humans live in fear of the giant Sandworms that infect the planet whereas the Fremen ride them as a coming of age ritual. Indeed, Paul has to ride a worm if the Fremen are to follow him.<br><br><img src=""https://images.gr-assets.com/photos/1435130761p8/1200254.jpg"" width=""400"" height=""573"" alt=""description"" class=""gr-hostedUserImg"" loading=""lazy""><br><br><b> Deep characters </b><br><br>The result of this is a very complex, and intriguing plot. I found the first third of this book to be very perplexing initially. This is a world we are told about rather than shown at the start. We hear about the Fremen but do not truly understand them till the very end. I was very overwhelmed at the beginning, and in all honesty I do think this novel merits a re-read to further establish my understanding of it. This did affect my rating because it inhibited by enjoyment of the book. <br><br><i>“Deep in the human unconscious is a pervasive need for a logical universe that makes sense. But the real universe is always one step beyond logic.”</i><br><br>Indeed, aside from Paul there is a whole host of dynamic, and well rounded, characters. His mother is to be the new revered mother of the Fremen people, which for someone of her age is quite remarkable. There is also the captain of Duke Leto’s household guard who is a very deep and honourable individual. As much as I came to like these characters I was still frustrated with the writing of them in the beginning. I found it difficult to read scenes in which up to four characters internal thoughts are portrayed alongside their dialogue. It wasn’t always clear who was thinking. I much prefer a narrative that is focalised through one person. Well, at least one person per chapter. <br><br> <img src=""https://images.gr-assets.com/photos/1435134456p8/1200280.jpg"" width=""400"" height=""419"" alt=""description"" class=""gr-hostedUserImg"" loading=""lazy""><br><br>Overall, I thought the idea behind this novel was utterly fantastic. However, my personal reaction to the writing style limited my overall enjoyment of the book. I do intend to read some of the sequels. However, I do not have any intention of doing so in the near future. Maybe, in a couple of years I will return to the brilliant, and annoyingly written, world of Dune.<br><br>__________________________________<br><br>You can connect with me on social media via <a href=""https://linktr.ee/sean.ultra_vegan1"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">My Linktree</a>.<br>__________________________________",5
"Why You Should Read Dune (video): <a target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" href=""https://youtu.be/oOomSvGXfaM"">https://youtu.be/oOomSvGXfaM</a><br /><br />Asking me to describe why Dune is so important to me is like asking a child to explain nuclear fusion. I do my best in the video linked above, but just know it probably isn't for the reasons you think.<br /><br />My journey to Dune becoming my absolute favorite book of all time goes all the way back to the mid-1990's upon finding it in my high school library and deciding to give it a try because I remembered my dad and brother watching the movie when I was a kid. At 15 years old, I got to the middle of ""book II"" and gave it a big fat DNF. I decided it just wasn't for me. At 17, for the 30th anniversary, I decided to try again and while I finished it that time, I thought the ideas were overly pretentious and way too out there. But a year went by and somehow, it was still in my head. I thought about it frequently and I began to ponder...did I actually really like it?<br /><br />I tried again the final weeks of my senior year of high school and became absolutely obsessed and it has stayed that way for almost the last 25 years.<br /><br />Dune is social science-fiction in that it's more concerned with the people and society than it is with hard science. Besides telling you that these navigators ""fold space"" for interstellar travel, Herbert doesn't bog you down with the math. He focuses more on the politics, cultures, religion, and philosophies of a world rich in the most valuable resource in the known universe, but barren in everything else.<br /><br />If you go into the story expecting a Star Wars style adventure, you're going to leave disappointed. Dune is extremely thought provoking and deals with the struggles of coming of age while the fate of the universe is on your shoulders. <br /><br />I'll also say that the book is certainly not for everyone. If you love things like ASOIAF and The Wheel of Time, there is no way this book won't be for you as both of those series borrowed heavily from the story Frank crafted. But I think it truly depends on where you are at in your life. Look, I just told you the story of how it took until my third reading for this to really click with me. Those who the story and lessons click with, it REALLY clicks with. But, again, this isn't a crowd pleaser and not everyone is going to love it, especially modern readers. So while I encourage those that are interested to read it, I expect more modern readers to not like it than like it.<br /><br />Not only is this the greatest science-fiction story of all time, but I believe it should be on mandatory reading lists in schools and everyone interested in the genre owe it to themselves to read the pillar of the genre they have come to love. Dune is every bit to science-fiction what Lord of the Rings is to fantasy.",5

  <i>“I have seen a friend become a worshiper, he thought.”</i>
</blockquote>I don’t think I actually *enjoyed* this book.<b> But I certainly respected the hell out of it. </b>For a bit I thought I had it all figured out, pegged it as your bog-standard Chosen One story, and then it went where I didn’t think it’d go and neatly subverted my expectations.

And for that I seriously respected this dense complex tome. <br><br><b>We people tend to love the idea of a charismatic all-powerful leader who inspires faithful following and true fervor, that cult-like blind devotion</b>. We give those leaders tremendous power to lead and decide and determine fates. So many stories rooted in the weight of our species collective history glorify this; so many countries still apparently yearn for powerful visionary leaders that others proclaim to be dictators. So many religions go to wars over the legacy left by a popular charismatic leader centuries ago, interpreting those legacies as the engine for the action, destruction, obedience.<br><br>Hero worship.

The book ends in an ambiguous place, and I presume the sequels may develop the theme or run away from it and make this a more traditional hero journey. But I certainly hope not. <b>Because the dark implications of messianism say more about human nature than the happier stories based on the same idea, but with more idealism</b>. We love our ideas of ideal benevolent rulers who can set things right, don’t we? Or the martyr figures inspiring “righteous” battles? Messiahs and figureheads seem to fulfill the deep-seated cultural longing for an inspirational leader, don’t they? <b>Friends become followers and worshippers, and the metaphorical slope becomes quite slippery</b>. <br><blockquote>
  <i> “The Fremen have a simple, practical religion,"" he said.<br>""Nothing about religion is simple,"" she warned.<br>But Paul, seeing the clouded future that still hung over them, found himself swayed by anger.

</blockquote><br>But Paul through his prescient powers can see what his mythologized destiny leads to. <b>A galactic scale slaughter led by fanatics in his name.</b> And there is not a way to escape it, once your life fits the mysticism of their faith (even if the faith and prophecies were stealthily prereplanted for sort of a similar purpose). Religious fanatics are destined to wage a brutal war that the Messiah is unable to stop. <br><blockquote>
  <i>���When law and duty are one, united by religion, you never become fully conscious, fully aware of yourself. You are always a little less than an individual.”</i>

Remember, we speak now of the Muad'Dib who ordered battle drums made from his enemies' skins, the Muad'Dib who denied the conventions of his ducal past with a wave of the hand, saying merely: ""I am the Kwisatz Haderach.

The place of nightmares, written vividly and skillfully, making me want to gulp down a gallon of drink just because I can, <b>making me appreciate that my reality doesn’t hinge on surviving on my reclaimed bodily fluids.</b><br><br>The world is harsh, unforgiving, brutal, hostile. The characters - well, mostly Paul, but to an extent his mother Jessica as well - are cold, calculating, composed and often very unsympathetic. Paul’s father values lives over property. Paul’s actions, on the other hand, lead to eyebrow-raising among his father’s old lieutenants who note the difference in priorities:<br><blockquote>
  <i> “Nothing money won't repair, I presume,"" Paul said.<br>""Except for the lives, m'Lord,"" Gurney said, and there was a tone of reproach in his voice as though to say: ""When did an Atreides worry first about things when people were at stake?”</i>
</blockquote><br>It’s dense and complex, full of politics, short on actual science fiction but full of ruminations on human nature — and it leaves me feeling that all of this is a beginning of another cycle of violence, just with a new figurehead at the mast. As Terry Pratchett said, <i>“But here's some advice, boy. Don't put your trust in revolutions. They always come around again. That's why they're called revolutions.”</i> <b>A new Hero or a new Messiah comes, and begets another cycle or struggle and violence, to be reset anew by a new figurehead sometimes in the future</b>.

"Seems as if they might be duned to be addicted to spice, all good old barbarians on magic mushrooms style.<br /><br />Quite dusty, especially regarding how to put the different parts of this behemoth series in the big picture of sci-fi because each part (of the 3 I´ve read so far and very probably won´t restart trying to read the 4th and 5th part) presents something different. Essentially, only this, the first one, is a real science fantasy epos, while the others are mostly circulating around the characters' special skills and family problems without much meta, plot, or different settings.<br /><br />Just this first milestone is big in the epic worldbuilding department and some other things I´ll try to point my primate fingers at. As unrealistic as water scarcity in such a highly developed galactic civilization seems, it´s a perfect explanation for creating the blue eyed mind mutants and the misandrist female breeding gang, that don´t ever need to kick male butts, because they preemptively avoid that situation to become real.<br /><br />Real life implications and innuendos.<br />I don´t know if Herbert had any kind of real civilizations, cultures, or traditions in mind when he constructed the tribes, today it would probably fall under any kind of politically correct bigoted do gooder codex, but there could lie a ton of creative writing gold in exploring this question of how to implement any past or present movement, society, tradition, faith into different sci-fi subgenres. Because how the traditions, monsters, and badass special moves of the inhabitants influence the planetary and intergalactic trade and travel balance is slowly presented to the reader, while the impact of the wonderful spice expands its glow towards total domination.<br /><br />Don´t take drugs except they make you superhuman<br />As so often, a prescription free pharmaceutical wonder cure can solve all of your problems until corporate interests come and ruin everything by using anything in their armory to get control over the precious resource of psychohistoric psi precognition power. The idea of one substance changing the whole balance of power of the galaxy is big in many sci-fi series and especially terrifying for each arrogant, high tech civilization, because an animal creating impervious shields, an immortality tonic, a mind altering super drug, etc., could enable far weaker, steampunky tribes to destroy them. Classic barbarian hordes on magic mushrooms looting Rome style.<br /><br />Bene Gesserit<br />Who says that centuries long, epigenetic, elitist breeding programs have to be completely evil all the time? Except for the poor lovers aroused by the wrong, not arranged partner, stupid Romeo and Juliet syndrome complexes, you have to see the bigger picture and control your hormones and feelings and sacrifice some biochemical illusions to create the ÜberPsi mentat mentalist mind penetrator. However, it works with less evil too. Together with the spice, this elite mental mind control academy with the aim to finally create the ultimate space JC messiah figure to defecate rainbows, freaking galactic peace, pink unicorns, and gold, is the backbone of the whole trilogy, because impacts of both and the excessive use of it as MacGuffins and Chekhovs plot devices lead to the question:<br /><br />Is this still really sci-fi or not more a high fantasy thing with some sci-fi elements?<br />Well, highly subjectively, yes, Dune is mostly psi fantasy dressed in futuristic clothes with some faith, tech, technobabble (rare), and trade in between, which makes it one of the most outstanding and unusual sci-fi works, I mean fantasy camouflaged as sci-fi. Tricky, one is so indoctrinated to call this thing sci-fi that it took me a reread and absorbing many reviews to realize what´s really going on. I´m really not sure about this whole thing, I´ve read a ton of sci-fi and my alien mind parasite, in a kind of perverted symbiosis with the xenovirus making me look fresher I deliberately bought for this purpose like a tapeworm therapy to lose weight (you don´t want to know what this costs on the alien bioweapons black market, the second half of my immortal soul exactly), tells me that there still would a lot of story without the sci-fi elements, while close to nothing would be there after removing fantasy, faith, drugs, and mind penetrating abilities, so, yea. I mean, even the planet itself doesn´t really has sci-fi fractions or something, the space around it is kind of empty without many sci-fi parties, cyborgs, aliens, everything substantial seen in close to any big sci-fi series. This leads me to <br /><br />An unpopular and possibly controversial opinion<br />It could be that Herbert is, and I am just talking about the sci-fi aspect, a bit overrated or, let´s precisely define it, overhyped as a sci-fi author because he is more of a fantasy writer. This couldn´t happen in a fantasy world, because parts of the legions of readers of the genre don´t want aliens and Clarketech mixed in their magic, not to speak of the suspension of disbelief problem that often comes with sudden future tech elements in fantasy, that´s just disgusting. The other way round, as with Dune, is much easier, just put some sci-fi around fantasy and everything just rolls perfectly. <br /><br />Is terraforming destroying cultural heritage or making inhabitable worlds paradises?<br />The ethical implications of this question are another sci-fi old school vehicle, especially if the terrible acid rain, high gravity, parasite infested, or dirty desert land is the only region where the special, red plotline device can grow and thrive. One could go so far as to ask if there are real life examples on earth, conservation vs corporate environmentalism, greenwashing and stuff (spoiler warning: conservation lost, earth is dying), and how this should be dealt with in decades, centuries, or millennia when we (I hope you are immortal too thanks to alien symbiont virus cooperation like me, if you aren´t, poor you, may I infect you? Just 20.000 of whatever your fringe financial system uses as fiat money that will be worthless as soon as natural apocalypse, mutually assured destruction, or alien invasion make it obsolete, and you get the parcel. Shipping not included.) start manipulating weather, geophysics and- chemistry, and climate of other worlds to make it sexy, tropical, tourist friendly paradises at the low cost of exterminating all alien life, but this would be a bit far fetched. <br /><br />Herberts´place in the sci-fi or sci-fa hall of fame.<br />That´s tricky, especially because he just couldn´t keep delivering after the third part. I´ve played around with the fourth and fifth part, but had to abandon it because it escalated to too much unmotivated, philosophical drivel without a real plotline and a place in the big picture of the series, Herbert just didn´t manage to hold it all together. What made the first three parts, that they are kind of eccentric, ingenious standalones without the classic space opera series uniting plotline and style, great, kind of destroyed the rest of the series. Because he had no more vision for the meta, high sci fa elements, Herbert lost control over his own creation and just manufactured hearthless shells to sell more books.<br /><br />But that doesn´t mean that the first three parts aren´t milestones of the interdisciplinary genre, exploring it in new ways no one imagined before while reaching Lem-, Clarke-, and Asimov levels of subtle, intelligent dialogues, innuendos, connotations, and character driven development. It´s something unique, special, and definitively not for anyone because of its high entry barriers that may annoy some readers, but don´t let yourself be easily deterred by that, it´s totally worth it once you´re in and high as heck and addicted forever to the wonderful, delicious spice melange. <br /><br />Tropes show how literature is conceptualized and created and which mixture of elements makes works and genres unique: <br /><a target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" href=""https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dune"">https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.ph...</a>",5
"<i>Dune</i> is often considered a masterpiece of 20th-century American science fiction. In part, the book owes its reputation to the film adaptation David Lynch directed in the early 1980s (although this movie was, and still is, not considered one of his best). Frank Herbert wrote a novel of epic proportions, in other words, a <i>space opera</i>, with its intergalactic feudal society, its decadent (if not evil) empire and its band of rebels: the book was published some ten years before the first instalment of the <i>Star Wars</i> series. Indeed, along with Asimov’s (overrated) <a href=""https://goodreads.com/book/show/29579.Foundation__Foundation___1_"" title=""Foundation (Foundation, #1) by Isaac Asimov"" rel=""noopener"">Foundation</a> stories, it was George Lucas’ primary source of inspiration.<br /><br />One of the most exciting aspects of Herbert’s creation is the multi-cultural world he depicts. Each house (Atreides, Harkonnen, etc.), each planet (Arrakis, Giedi Prime, Caladan...), each group (the Fremen, the Bene Gesserit, the Guild, the Emperor’s suite and the Sardaukars) has its specific flavour, its own culture, its language — the comprehensive index at the end of the book is utterly fascinating. For each of these cultures, Herbert borrowed traits from traditions (ancient or contemporary) he knew well in reality, especially from the Middle East. In particular, Paul Atreides / Muad’Dib’s story among the Fremen is redolent of the historical events around T.E. Lawrence and the Arab revolt against the Ottoman Empire. And Paul’s crusade on Arrakis is told, as though it were ancient history, in the chronicles <i>by the Princess Irulan</i> at the start of each chapter.<br /><br />Herbert describes his fictional world and characters in great detail, which contributes to the richness of his narrative, but I found these descriptions somewhat boring and, especially, the middle of the book is a bit dragging for that reason. In my view, the most impressive parts of this novel are the dialogues, where Herbert simultaneously reveals what the characters are saying and thinking. This technique lends a sense of duplicity and scheming to almost every interaction. Everyone is plotting one way or another so that the whole thing ends up being like a great Shakespearean play, with dialogues and asides, tyrants and pretenders. What confirms this impression is not only the theme of the exiled Duke (see <a href=""https://goodreads.com/book/show/42607.As_You_Like_It"" title=""As You Like It by William Shakespeare"" rel=""noopener"">As You Like It</a>, <a href=""https://goodreads.com/book/show/12938.King_Lear"" title=""King Lear by William Shakespeare"" rel=""noopener"">King Lear</a>, or <a href=""https://goodreads.com/book/show/12985.The_Tempest"" title=""The Tempest by William Shakespeare"" rel=""noopener"">The Tempest</a>), but also the repeated scenes of fencing duels throughout, with feints and poisoned tips: a clear allusion to the endings of <a href=""https://goodreads.com/book/show/1420.Hamlet"" title=""Hamlet by William Shakespeare"" rel=""noopener"">Hamlet</a> and <a href=""https://goodreads.com/book/show/8852.Macbeth"" title=""Macbeth by William Shakespeare"" rel=""noopener"">Macbeth</a>, for instance.<br /><br /><i>Edit</i>: A word about Denis Villeneuve’s new film adaptation of Herbert’s novel (part 1, 2021). Comparisons are odious and obviously wouldn’t be to David Lynch’s advantage. This is a <i>Dune</i> version for a new generation of fans and an epic movie on par with Peter Jackson’s <i>Lord of the Rings</i> trilogy, in the early 2000s. The settings (filmed in Scandinavia and the Middle East) are breathtaking, and the actors have so much going for them. But what strikes me the most in this new version is the sense that everything is overwhelming and sublime: the massive architecture, the crushing machines, the extreme weather conditions, the earth-shattering landscapes, the thunderous music, the tragic events, the repulsive foes. From the relenting waves of Caladan to the searing and unending skies of Arrakis, everything assumes an oceanic and staggering dimension.",5
"Update! Just wanted to say how much I loved the movie. Go see it. It was probably good that there was a gap between the time I read this and the movie. <br /><br />Read 2015<br />Amazing! A masterpiece of SF with which I will probably compare all SF books that I’ll read in the future. It goes in my favorites shelf. <br /><br />This is my 3rd attempt to read Dune and I am really grateful that I did not succeed the first two times I tried as I was too young to understand all the subtleties. I would have probably enjoyed it as a very well written adventure novel but nothing more. That would have been a pity as Dune is so much more than a story about space travel and epic battles between good and evil. It presents complex philosophical ideas, explores ecological issues, cultural identity and differences. Also a major theme is represented by religion and religious leadership. <br /><br />The disturbing part about this book, taken in the current political context, (I am not sure if Herbert did it on purpose or not) is how easily the Fremen can be identified with an Arab nation. The spice can be seen as “oil” and the Harkonnens as evil westerners/Russians that are exploiting the natural resources without thinking about the locals and the environment. I saw that others reviewers saw this as well.",5
"I blame the movie.<br><br>I was an avid but novice fantasy and sci-fi reader in 1984 when David Lynch’s <i>Dune</i> rolled out as a big-budget adaptation of the 1965 classic book. It was an artistic and box-office failure with Roger Ebert calling it “a real mess, an incomprehensible, ugly, unstructured, pointless excursion.” Numerous references were made to its excessive length, particularly a tv edition that was over 3 hours long.

"‘<i>Deep in the human unconscious is a pervasive need for a logical universe that makes sense. But the real universe is always one step beyond logic.</i>’<br /><br />The sheer scope and magnitude of this 1965 sci-fi drama is staggering, populated with an extensive cast of characters and a rich universe full of well-rounded lore, intricate politics where every actions is revealed as ‘<i>plans within plans within plans,</i>’ and dynamic cultures all set on a collision course of plot that rightfully earned it a wide readership and canonization as a “Classic” work. I found it lived up to the hype and opened itself up more upon a reread, validating the fond memories I had of it from reading it first as a young teenager smitten with anything sci-fi. This book has zero chill and everything is to extreme and epic levels, including the size of worms. But come for the Bene Gesserits, best part. While there isn’t much to say that likely hasn’t already been said better, I still want to pause and reflect on some key elements in <i>Dune</i>. This is such a well-crafted book that addresses themes of power, religion, historical records as mythmaking and environmental concerns in a narrative about proxy wars and power struggles that speak just as loudly today as it did about 1960s foreign policy. If you are looking for a book of epic proportions, you can’t go wrong with <i>Dune</i>.<br /><br />The best part about this book, to me, is the way it is constantly expanding. There is great world-building and a rich lore that recalls my glee first exploring <a href=""https://goodreads.com/book/show/33.The_Lord_of_the_Rings"" title=""The Lord of the Rings by J.R.R. Tolkien"" rel=""noopener"">The Lord of the Rings</a>, but what really excites me is the way Herbert reveals it all. The book starts so small—a visit to a cottage from an old woman that seems like such a small scale fairy tale on page one—and swiftly becomes gargantuan and never stops growing. It leaves you constantly feeling yourself shrink beside a universe always revealing itself as more complex than you had realized. I enjoy the way Herbert only gives you the minimum of what you need to understand and lets it all slowly unfold when necessary.<br /><br />‘<i>They've a legend here, a prophecy, that a leader will come to them, child of a Bene Gesserit, to lead them to true freedom. It follows the familiar messiah pattern.</i>’<br /><br />For newcomers, the basis of the book is that Paul has been quite literally bred to be a messiah and is engulfed in a difficult power struggle over a planet that essentially upholds the interplanetary economy through mining an addictive substance called “spice”. You might quickly find yourself thinking of spice as oil and the planet Arrakis as Middle East and Northern Africa (Tor put out a really <a href=""https://www.tor.com/2021/10/18/the-muslimness-of-dune-a-close-reading-of-appendix-ii-the-religion-of-dune/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">great essay on the way Herbert engages with Muslim culture and traditions</a>), you know, since there was a whole Cold War going on at the time and giving the villain Baron Harkonnen a first name like Vladimir might make you wonder if this is all an elaborate metaphor. The Baron saying ‘<i>in politics, the tripod is the most unstable of all structures,</i>’ might make you think of the three branches of US government. You get the idea. There are also WWII holdovers present, such as the Sardaukar as an elite fighting force trained on Salusa Secundus to make sure you catch the S.S. reference. That’s all very much there, but this book is so much more than a simple sci fi rendition of the Cold War and Herbert definitely wants you to apply these themes to our larger political and religious global interactions. <br /><br />‘<i>Fear is the mind-killer.</i>’<br /><br />Another aspect I find fascinating in <i>Dune</i> is the depiction of Paul Atreides in the ‘chosen one’ trope. Paul has reservations, though not due to thinking he doesn’t deserve it (dude is royalty anyways, essentially) but because he fears what it will bring. Paul’s powers are enhanced through spice and he is able to perceive the future, and in almost every possible scenario he sees nothing but mass war in his name:<br /><blockquote>’<i>They were all caught up in the need of their race to renew its scattered inheritance, to cross and mingle and infuse their bloodlines in a great new pooling of genes. And the race knew only one sure way for this—the ancient way, the tried and certain way that rolled over everything in its path: jihad.</i>’</blockquote><br />The notion of precognition brings free will into question, particularly when a certain individual appears in visions of the future but dies before it happens. It becomes a universe where individual free wills are all acting upon one another in an attempt to control the narrative of time.<br /><blockquote>’<i>And what [Paul] saw was a time nexus within this cave, a boiling of possibilities focused here, wherein the most minute action—a wink of an eye, a careless word, a misplaced grain of sand—moved a gigantic lever across the known universe. He saw violence with the outcome subject to so many variables that his slightest movement created vast shiftings in the pattern.</i>’</blockquote><br />History is written by the winners, or so the saying goes, and much of this novel focuses on the way the narrative of time is constructed through the mythologizing of people and events. ‘<i>History will call us wives,</i>’ Jessica says to Chani, assuring her that her role as the lover to Paul will not be usurped by the princess he marries for the throne. Much of the book shows the dynamics between Paul as the Man and Paul as the myth, with characters like Stilgar recognizing that by being in service to the myth they too will be immortalized in the stories. Narratives become a form or power, and, as I’ll discuss soon, can be a form of control.<br /><br />Perhaps it is because power and control are so central to this novel that it feels so very timeless and just as applicable to 2021 as it did to 1965. In regards to power, leadership also becomes another key theme. ‘<i>Power and fear,</i>’ House Atreides Duke Leto says, ‘<i>The tools of statecraft, </i>’ a sentiment later echoed with all the same key terms by Baron Harkonnen. The two leaders are set up at the start as foils to each other, each trying to have their grip on Arrakis (there are some strong colonialism themes in this book and it delves into how troubling it is and how even those we might view as the savior turn out to be just another oppressor and colonizer) but their leaderships are defined by Leto’s rule through caring for his people while Harkonnen sees everyone as a useful pawn.<br /><blockquote>’<i>A leader, you see, is one of the things that distinguishes a mob from a people. He maintains the level of individuals. Too few individuals, and a people reverts to a mob.</i>’</blockquote><br />Having recently finished <a href=""https://goodreads.com/book/show/13651.The_Dispossessed_An_Ambiguous_Utopia"" title=""The Dispossessed An Ambiguous Utopia by Ursula K. Le Guin"" rel=""noopener"">The Dispossessed</a>, I could have preferred some more voices in this book looking for better forms of ruling that don’t involve exploitation, but that’s not what this book is about so I’ll move on. What this book really focuses on is the ways power can be maintained, which crops up most in this novel through use of religion. ‘<i>But it's well known that repression makes a religion flourish,</i>’ we read, and the harsh life on Arrakis makes it the perfect setting where indoctrination of religion for the purpose of power can shape a community and unite them. Religion is a form of storytelling, having the people all believe in one shared story with all its myths and promises. ‘<i>You deliberately cultivated this air, this bravura,</i>’ Jessica instructs Paul, ‘<i>you never cease indoctrinating.</i>’ The stronger the shared faith, the more easily a leader can make them do what they need. It also helps that everyone is high as shit all the time. ‘<i>Religion and law among our masses must be one and the same,</i>’ Kynes's father says:<br /><blockquote>‘<i>An act of disobedience must be a sin and require religious penalties. This will have the dual benefit of bringing both greater obedience and greater bravery. We must depend not so much on the bravery of individuals, you see, as upon the bravery of a whole population.</i>’</blockquote><br />Religion is being used constantly to shape the people for the purpose of their leaders, even in what seems an admirable purpose of turning desert Arrakis into a green paradise (and without a religious idea of paradise, how can a people who only know dry dirt and hardship even imagine a paradise?).<br /><br />‘<i>The real wealth of a planet is in its landscape, how we take part in that basic source of civilization—agriculture.</i>’<br /><br />This latter bit is also extremely key to Dune. The planet itself is practically a character in the novel, much in the ways the landscape is like a character in Westerns. The landscape of Arrakis truly shapes the people there, and we see a contrast between Arrakis and Caladan and how water as a precious resource on Arrakis changes many customs. Such as how spitting at a person is a sign of respect on Arrakis. Changing the environment on Arrakis is an interesting concept because, in order to make it thrive, what would the cost be? Would it disrupt spice, thereby collapsing the galaxy’s economy? Can these people ever be free, because doing so would require the complete dismantling of the governmental systems currently ruling?<br /><br />There is also something to be said about the harshness of an environment being an ideal place for strenght in unity around a cause to crop up. Le Guin explores this in <i>The Dispossessed</i> as well, with the anarchist planet having a similar dry desert vibe as Arrakis and scarcity being a major player in what keeps the people bonded and working together. The Fremen are tough because of their environment, similiarly the Sardaukar are trained in extremely harsh environments as well. <i>Dune</i> plays a lot with ideas on how fascism and strongmen can quickly rise to power in times of economic instability—or the threat of it—and here the difficult planets tend to produce the most deadly fighters. Mix religion in and you have an instant army if you can convince everyone you are the chosen one. <br /><br />There is so much more to discuss in this book, particularly the Bene Gesserits and the Guild who are pulling a lot of strings, or just how friggen awesome the worms are. This is a big book with a lot of big ideas, and also a lot of ambiguity to them that I really appreciate. It is certainly a precursor for a lot of popular epics to follow. George Lucas certainly took notes and I imagine <a href=""https://goodreads.com/author/show/346732.George_R_R__Martin"" title=""George R.R. Martin"" rel=""noopener"">George R.R. Martin</a> read this and said “wait, you can just <i>kill</i> beloved characters that easily!?” before rewriting Duke Leto as Ned Stark. While I can concede to those who find it boring and dry, I rather enjoyed all the history and lore and found this to be incredibly fun. <br /><br /><b>4.5/5</b>",4
"[UPDATED]<br />I reread <u>Dune</u> for the first time in several decades and immensely enjoyed it. I also went back to watch the original cult feature film by David Lynch and had quite mixed feelings - while it was close to the overall aesthetic that Frank Herbert describes with the gorgeous desert sets and the terrifying worms, the parts of the story that were necessarily culled out was disturbing (that and the woeful special effects at the time trying (and IMHO failing) to visualize the personal shields that the characters wear in hand-to-hand combat). <br /><br />For those who are just discovering Dune for the first time, it is essentially a messianic story on a desert planet (think of Jesus or perhaps Mohammed on Tatooine) in a universe dominated by a cartel (the Guild also known as CHOAM) with a monopoly on a drug (called mélange) derived from a rare material (spice) available only on the desert planet Arrakis (Dune). This drug is so powerful that it allows the Guild (and later Maud'dib) to leverage space-time singularities to defy the speed of light and travel anywhere in the universe. Overlaid on this foundation, the epic battle of the feudal houses of the noble Atreides and the evil Harkkonen houses rages, the betrayal of the former by the latter explicitly endorsed by the Emperor (himself an almost impuissant pawn of the Guild as well). All that to say that the fabric of the story is multilayered and as complex and complete a universe as you will find in George RR Martin or Dan Simmons. <br /><br />There are several enhanced human species running around: the Mentats who have been cerebrally enhanced to be able to calculate like supercomputers (computers themselves having been banned!) and each then uses their predictive analytics for their assigned Dukes (or the Emperor) and the Bene Gesserit cult who are a sort of quasi-religious non-celibate nuns who have honed perception and language to the point of having developed nearly superpower-level strengths of persuasion which are almost universally feared and vilified as sorcery in the rest of the universe. Paul Atreides, heir to the throne, is born to Jessica, a Bene Gesserit, possessed some of these powers and when the family moves to Arrakis (part of the aforementioned Harkkonen plot) from their home planet Caladon, he appears to the native Freeman population as perhaps a fulfillment of their messianic prophecies and hopes. <br /><br />In perhaps the most critical departure from the book, the Lynch movie does not really show Paul questioning the awesome power that he possesses and his assumption of the mantle as the Arrakis Messiah, the Maud'dib (something that the 2021 film by Denis Villeneuve does thankfully address). In the book, one aspect that I loved was how Paul struggled with this messianic destiny and did everything he could to subvert it. One of the unique gifts he received, presumably as the rare and unique offspring of a Bene Gesserit, was the ability to see possible outcomes (like a Mentat) and thus he could take decisions based on the most likely foreseen outcome. It made for great reading.<br /><br />The other great thing about Dune is the aesthetic of this desert planet with impossibly huge worms under the surface who are mysteriously connected to spice and pose a danger to all creatures in the desert except for the Freeman. The still suit which recycles body water in the deep desert was brilliant as was the ever-present obsession with ""water debt"" of the Freemen. I really felt like I was walking unevenly (must not attract the worms!) through the sand with Jessica and Paul before their fateful encounter with the Freemen. <br /><br />Dune is a well-deserved classic for all the reasons I mentioned above and probably much more that I missed. I have read it twice and gotten almost entirely different things out of it each time. I have since read all the canonical Frank Herbert books in the series and enjoyed it all immensely.<br /><br />[UPDATE] I am looking forward to Denis Villeneuve's Dune in October 2021. The previews I have seen so far seem to be quite coherent with respect to the book. I was a fan of Lynch's Dune and am curious to see what Villeneuve does with this one. Feel free to comment below.<br />[UPDATE] Villeneuve’s 2021 film covers half of the book and does a fantastic job as both an homage to Herbert’s book and Lynch’s film. The casting, costumes, CGI, and script are all top-notch. Dune lovers have every reason here for rejoicing. One key difference from the Lynch film is that we do not see the Guild Navigators, so we can hope that they show up in the second half!<br /><br />Fino's Dune Reviews<br /><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2141191686"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Dune</a><br /><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1824213928"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Dune Messiah</a><br /><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1824213971"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Children of Dune</a><br /><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1824214042"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">God Emperor of Dune</a><br /><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1824214057"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Heretics of Dune</a><br /><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1824214081"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Chapterhouse: Dune</a>",5
"<b>3.5/5 Stars<br><br>Dune oh Dune, seems like I need to raise my Shield Wall for this review.</b><br><br>Dune is one of the most important pieces of literature for the Sci-Fi genre. I’ve been raking my brain for hours on how to properly explain the importance of Dune in the sci-fi literature but you know what? I dune (hehehe) think it’s necessary for me to do so. If you truly wanna know why, you can search it on whatever search engine you use and you'll find hundreds of articles or reviews on why this book is that important; and they’ll do a much better job than me. I won’t even deny any of them because, in my opinion, this book was truly revolutionary. Dune didn’t become the number one highest selling Sci-fi novel of all time for no reason; like Brian Herbert said, it is to Sci-Fi, what the LOTR trilogy is to fantasy.<br><br>Theoretically, if I’m reviewing this by putting my head as someone from 1960’s or 1970’s, I know I would think of this book as my bible. 1965 was the year when Dune was published for the first time, 24 years before I was born. There are just too many groundbreaking ideas, world-building, that would become the inspirations for many Sci-fi in our time; I only realized this after reading this book. I mean, the gigantic Sandworm alone has inspired many video games to use it as a common monster or enemy. <br><br><b>Picture: Dune by Marc Simonetti</b><br><br><img src=""https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1510335641i/24412654._SX540_.jpg"" width=""400"" class=""gr-hostedUserImg"" loading=""lazy""><br><br>Desert planet, Stillsuits, space exploration, and Zen Buddhism, Dune was truly a groundbreaking novel, almost everything in this book somehow seems prophetic because it has predicted our current society, especially when it comes to faith, emotional control, empathy, and the importance of ecology and scarcity.<br><br><b>

    <blockquote>“The mind commands the body and it obeys. The mind orders itself and meets resistance.”</blockquote>

</b><br><br>Part of what made this book was great for me was Herbert’s prose. I haven’t read enough classic to claim it was classical, but Herbert’s prose was definitely unique to me. It has a lot of freedom by writing it from a limited omniscient narrative; changing POV’s repeatedly in a single chapter without any warning. This is, honestly, one of my biggest pet peeves in my usual read, but Herbert made it work because all his characters were really well written, distinct in their personality, and the dialogues are really well dune (HEHEHE). Plus, there are so many motivational and extremely philosophical quotes that seem to make this book a combination of Sci-Fi &amp; self-help book, such as:<br><br><b>
  <i>
    <blockquote>“It is so shocking to find out how many people do not believe that they can learn, and how many more believe learning to be difficult.”</blockquote>
  </i>
</b><br><br>And of course, the most famous and one of the best quote I’ve ever read out of any book<br><br><b>
  <i>
    <blockquote>“I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.”</blockquote>

</b><br><br>I can’t believe I have gone through life without knowing about this litany against fear. It’s applicable in any kind of hardship we faced in real life, and I know it will be one of my motto starting from now. If I’m judging this book solely from how significant this book was, I’ll give it maximum score in a heartbeat. However, I’m reviewing this based on one question and how I rated all the books I read: <b>was it enjoyable?</b><br><br>The answer is yes and no, it was a mixed bag. The first part of this book was incredible, I couldn’t put down the book and everything was so interesting and compelling. Then comes the second part, where the pacing just became really draggy and somehow, boring. However, my hope was restored for a while during the third act, until the anti-climax happened. My expectation is obviously at fault here but hey, this book is the number one highest selling sci-fi book of all time and one of the most highly acclaimed book, I expected there to be a mind-blowing climax sequences to close the book in an epic way. But no, there wasn’t any. Not only it felt anti-climactic, Herbert’s prose in describing settings and actions didn’t age well or up to current standard. The main reason for this is that this is a book that relies heavily on character’s dialogues to do everything; world-building, plot, characterizations were done solely through dialogues. This leads to the great plot but weak action sequences and no vivid settings. Sure there was some explanation on the settings, but other than the planet—which is just a desert, just search Sahara or Planet Tatooine and voila—the interiors were given only brief description, which makes it hard to imagine; I had to look up some artworks to be able to immerse myself in the settings of the book.<br><br><b>Overall, Dune was truly a revolutionary book for its time that is filled with tons of imaginative and fantastic ideas.</b> Although there were some parts that disappointed me, I still liked the book and I finally understand why there are so much discussion and praises around this book. I recommend this to every Sci-fi fans for its importance and also, it’s good to know where most fantastic Sci-Fi you’ve read or you’re reading now got its idea from. However, this is also where I’ll stop with the series.<br><br><i>You can find <b><a href=""http://booknest.eu/reviews/pat/921-dune"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">this</a></b> and the rest of my Adult Epic/High Fantasy &amp; Sci-Fi reviews at <b><a href=""http://booknest.eu/review/patrick"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">BookNest</a></b></i>",3
"I have to write this review without rhythm so that it won’t attract a worm.<br /><br />In the distant future Arrakis is a hellhole desert planet where anyone who doesn’t die of thirst will probably be eaten by one of the giant sandworms. It’s also the only place where the precious spice melange can be found so it’s incredibly valuable, and the honorable Duke Leto Atreides has been ordered by the Padishah Emperor to take over control of Arrakis from his mortal enemies, the House Harkonnen. While this seems like a great offer on the surface the Duke and his people realize that it’s actually a cunning trap being set by the Emperor and Baron Harkonnen. <br /><br />The only hope seems to be allying with the local populace called Fremen whose harsh environment has led them to become an incredibly tough and disciplined people, but they have their own vision of what Arrakis should be. They also have a prophecy about the coming of a messiah figure who will lead them to freedom, and the Duke’s son Paul looks like he may be exactly who they’ve been waiting for.<br /><br />This is classic sci-fi that really deserves the label. What Frank Herbert accomplished in one novel is stunning because he built a fascinatingly detailed universe in which the politics, religion, economics, espionage, and military strategy are all equally important. He then blended these more grounded concepts with bigger sci-fi ideas like being able to use spice to see through space-time, and the scope of that encompasses trying to pick the proper path through various potential timelines as well as free will vs. fate. <br /><br />I think one of the factors that helps this story stay timeless is that so much of it is based on what humanity becomes vs. trying to predict what futuristic technology would be like. This is a society that once had a war with machines and has since rejected any type of computers so people have developed to fill the gap with the help of the spice. The Mentats are trained to use data to predict outcomes. The Navigators of the Guild have used so much of the spice to help them move through space that they’re mutating. The all female Bene Gesserit have developed a variety of skills to place their members alongside positions of power to help advance their breeding scheme that spans generations. Herbert also cleverly came up with an excuse that explains why knives and hand-to-hand combat are so important with the idea of the personal body shields. <br /><br />So even though we still got a good sci-fi’s novel worth of cool gadgets the emphasis is on what the people can do and how that’s developed over a long period of time. It also adds a lot of depth to the political dimensions because all of these groups have different agendas that cause them all to mistrust each other, but because they all fill these various roles none can exist without the others.<br /><br />There are also parallels to our world that are still in play because the idea of a desert people caught up in the power struggles of various outsiders because of their valuable natural resource is an obvious allegory to the Middle East that still works today. Plus, the classic film <i>Lawrence of Arabia</i> came out a few years before Herbert published this, and you have to think that it had some influence on him because there are elements of the story that seem very much inspired by it.<br /><br />While the whole concept of a Chosen One has gotten a bit worn over time that’s not Herbert’s fault, and this is still a fantastic sci-fi story with big ideas that also works as space opera as well as being an epic adventure story.",5
"When the epic and ensemble cast movie of Dennis Villenevue is about to release, I decided to choose this fantastic and also one of my favorite cult sci-fi series as flashback Saturday reading! ( it looks better than David Lynch- Kyle MacLachlan version but the looks may be deceiving! At least Timothy and Zendaya look so cool in those stylish clothes and grimy expressions on their faces) <br /><br />After nearly three decades later, holding this paperback into my hands is magical experience take me a time travel: my mom was banging on my room’s door and telling me go outside and be social, getting some tan, instead of self-isolating myself by burying my head into books for days and feeding myself with junk food! ( the past mom had no idea, billions of people in the earth will be forced to do the similar things I’ve done in 2020 because of different reasons . At least the 2020-me did exactly same things with one difference: I threw boozes into equation! ) <br /><br /> When I reread the series I clearly understand why I became addicted to the them( I’m talking about entire books)<br /><br />Firstly you find yourself drawn into this journey after reading few pages because Herbert’s storytelling skills are extraordinarily. The meaningful interludes, the character development, the impressive world building transform you to the other universe that you never want to leave. <br /><br />The awakening parts of Paul who discovers his own abilities, epic dynasty battles, ominous sand worms , intrigues, revenge, mind games present us a perfect blend of political economical, sociological, theological themes. <br />I advise you to read the books first to understand the deeply ideological messages and unique philosophy of the series because sometimes the screenwriters have hard time to absorb and reflect the entire soul of the book! At least by reading the main story by yourself, you may directly reach to the core! <br /><br /> Here are my favorite quotes of the book: <br /><br />“I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.”<br /><br />“Deep in the human unconscious is a pervasive need for a logical universe that makes sense. But the real universe is always one step beyond logic.”<br /><br />“The mystery of life isn't a problem to solve, but a reality to experience.”<br /><br />“When religion and politics travel in the same cart, the riders believe nothing can stand in their way. Their movements become headlong - faster and faster and faster. They put aside all thoughts of obstacles and forget the precipice does not show itself to the man in a blind rush until it's too late.”<br /><br />“Hope clouds observation.”<br /><br />“It is impossible to live in the past, difficult to live in the present and a waste to live in the future.”<br /><br />“Fear is the mind killer.”<br /><br />“Once men turned their thinking over to machines in the hope that this would set them free. But that only permitted other men with machines to enslave them.”",5
"<b>4 ⭐</b><br /><br />A word of warning as you venture out to peruse the veritable smorgasbord of delectable reviews for this Sci-Fi/Fantasy Classic!<br />Be sure to do your Du(n)e diligence. Be wary of key phrases such as “I don’t usually read Fantasy/Sci-Fi”, “Too many made-up words” or “I’m just reading before the movie comes out”. These individuals have come down with a bad case of bandwagonitis and any self-respecting Sci-Fier-er cannot count on their reviews being in any way accurate or beneficial!<br />As I’m firmly placed in the 3rd category of Blockbuster-hungry fools, I’d advise you to immediately move on to another review, there’s nothing of value here. In fact, I won’t actually be writing a review, I’ll simply address one simple question:<br /><br /><br /><b>What is Dune?</b><br /><br />Dune is sand as far as the eye can see.<br />Dune is the sphincter opening.... of a desert tent.<br />Dune is thirst.

"TW: pedophilia and rape off page<br /><br />Although this is discussed as a highly influential work in scifi, now having read it, I do think we have evolved past the need for this to be part of the canon. This book was a bit of a mess with the characters, world, and plot all feeling a bit disjointed and half baked. The world, while interesting and obviously very detailed, is barely explained to the reader and relies heavily on the appendix without actually providing context in the story (with the exception of a few things like spice and the worms). These characters all felt a little flat and/or underutilized. The plot felt like two separate books, while being peppered with themes of glorifying colonialism, white saviors, and lack of agency for most of the women. Although I understand that is a product of when it was written, it still points to how there are much better works that have been written since even if they were influenced by this. I’m interested to see what they do with the movie adaptation. I’ll have a review and discussion on my channel coming up. ",2
"<b>15-9-2021: saw the movie tonight and loved it’s esthetics and how it conveys the gravitas of the story</b><br /><br /><b>Like medieval (but the Islamic enlightenment version of it) times, a caste system and the oil industry imposed upon space opera, with mystical elements permeating the whole and simultaneously telling the rise of a Napoleon like hero. Dune sounds like a book that shouldn’t work, but does, in an unique, complex and compelling manner.</b><br /><i>The person who experiences greatness must have a feeling for the myth he is in. He must reflect what is projected upon him.</i><br /><br /><b>Start of the legend</b><br /><i>I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.</i><br /><br />The last 25% of the book was a wild ride that really upped my enjoyment of this reread, and left me impressed with the worldbuilding and boldness of <a href=""https://goodreads.com/author/show/58.Frank_Herbert"" title=""Frank Herbert"" rel=""noopener"">Frank Herbert</a>.<br />But to start: <a href=""https://goodreads.com/book/show/44767458.Dune__Dune___1_"" title=""Dune (Dune, #1) by Frank Herbert"" rel=""noopener"">Dune</a> is a classic in the scifi field, but is quite atypical. Technological progress has stalled after a jihad against thinking machines (aka computers) and a kind of medieval society in space has emerged. An emperor reigns, planets are dished out as fiefs and mysterious sects (<i>We Bene Gesserit sift people to find the humans.</i>) follow their own paths to influence events. Some kind of social darwinism is at play, and the conviction that humanity can be massively better (or worse) is we return our attention to oneself instead of towards technology.<br /><br />The terms are at the start quite hard to get into, even though I know the story and remember some of them from last time reading the book. Arrakis, the Dune from the title, is an other interesting thing. This desert planet is almost a separate character (<i>The highest function of ecology is understanding consequences</i>), being handed to the Atreides duke and worsening a blood feud with the Harkonnens, the previous owners of the planet.<br /><br />It is interesting how Herbert decided to reveal the first murder plot perpetrator quite soon, showing evidently that this is a book more about ideas then tension.<br />In general the book is biblical in language and the weight assigned to events, with foreshadowing and myths. The world feels rich and alive.<br /><br />The main character is Paul Atreides, the son of duke Leto. He is groomed to take on his role of leader of a major house, and by his Bene Gesserit mother Jessica (who is, for lack of a better analogy, a kind of crossing between a martial arts expert, nun and witch). There are several other retainers, who are depicted in a manner that I can only compare to <a href=""https://goodreads.com/book/show/33.The_Lord_of_the_Rings"" title=""The Lord of the Rings by J.R.R. Tolkien"" rel=""noopener"">The Lord of the Rings</a>.<br />The characters in general feel greater than life, for instance the level of perception and deduction at the dinner party is superhuman, I can only imagine because there is no advanced technology that the psychic training must somehow become more advanced and leads to the kind of casual analysis Jessica and Paul are capable of.<br /><br />The fall of house Atreides is still a brutal event, even if you know it is coming and feels swift and unexpected, as does Paul’s enlightenment.<br /><br /><b>Predetermination versus free will</b><br /><i>A kind of Heisenberg indeterminacy intervened: the expenditure of energy that revealed what he saw, changed what he saw.</i><br /><br />To be fair, halfway in the book I felt a kind of lull in reading. The main characters are thrown back upon themselves and need to establish themself amongst the Freemen, Bedouin like desert folk who are much more powerful than thought.<br />In these sections there is such a sensitivity to culture and worldbuilding, Tatooine or the Aiel of <a href=""https://goodreads.com/author/show/6252.Robert_Jordan"" title=""Robert Jordan"" rel=""noopener"">Robert Jordan</a> are nothing compared to the depth Herbert manages to bring go Arrakis and its Freemen. So much must have been thought of but has been left out, given a richness in the world conjured that is only rivaled by Middle Earth.<br /><br />The scenes are intense, and well written, but in way a bit dull since the ascent of Paul to power seems assured. There is banter that is really sharp, like:<br /><i>“Do you trust me?”<br />“I hear your sincerity.”</i><br />And Paul is shown as doubting, self aware of his rise and what it entails, commenting on heroism and mythmaking, and the restraints to his powers: (<i>The vision made him want to freeze into immobility, but this, too, was action with its consequences.</i>)<br /><br />But the third part, especially to the end, shows real boldness by skipping two years and taking on tragic events (<i>Grief is the price of victory</i>), sometimes only in an indirect manner.<br />Alia is a good example, and all the implications and struggles, guilt, she must bring with her. You feel it, it is touched upon, but never in an on the nose manner.<br />And the development of the relationship between Stilgar and Paul also carries sadness and an awareness of the corrosive power of adoration and myth: <i>I have seen a friend become a worshipper.</i><br /><br />The epicness of both the story and main character Paul (and a shoutout to Chani and Jessica as well) is just beyond anything. <br />For instance somewhere near the end Paul responds the following to a warning that the galactic emperor is coming down upon him in force:<br /><i>""When the Emperor learns that he’ll not rest until he has you over a slow fire.""<br />""The Emperor’s not likely to have that power over me.""</i><br /><br />Decadence as an indication of ineffectiveness and decline, while orthodoxy, returning to the core of human struggle for life, is a way out of the impasse, comes back as a theme.<br /><br />The actual enlightenment and power of Paul as gained by the spice is unknowable to a reader, since he operates on another level entirely. Time being a dimension, Paul transcends the three dimensions and becomes something inhuman along the way, a singularity like the technical singularity.<br /><br /><b>Some minor criticism</b> <br /><i>""How could you do such a foolish thing?"" she demanded.<br />""He is your son""</i><br /><br />Oké, what is this convenient weirding suddenly along the way?<br />Why is count Fenring there, what does he add in anyway to the story?<br />And how the hell does Paul get nuclear weapons all of the sudden.<br />And as said: the second part of the book really did not speak that much to me.<br /><br />But in no way it can be denied that the world conjured by Dune is rich, bold and interesting, and that I very much look forward to see the movie in 2021!<br /><br /><b>Bad ass quotes:</b><br /><i>She said that the mystery of life isn’t a problem to solve, but a reality to experience.<br /><br />...and the mystery of life is not a problem to solve but a reality to experience.<br /><br />The concept of progress acts as a protective mechanism to shield us from the terrors of the future.<br /><br />But the test of a man isn’t what you think he’ll do. It’s what he actually does.<br /><br />The people who can destroy a thing, they control it.<br /><br />The power to destroy a thing is the absolute control over it.</i>",4
